    <div class="writing-about">
      <p>This was the first philosophy term paper. It was written for Makayla Kelley who taught a group of MAPH students about free will as an introduction to the analytic tradition. In my defense, I had no idea what level of abstraction to work at, but I think a lot of these core ideas can be reworked. I'm definitely going to write more about agency assumptions in political philosophy, so I'll be back to scrub up my perspective. Oh god there's no spellcheck in this html.</p>

        <h3>A. Harry Frankfurt</h3>
        <p>In 1971, Harry Frankfurt introduced a compatibilist theory of free will that centers agent-action identification. Free will is a status available to agents with what Frankfurt calls the 'human will structure' which involves three key elements: the will, first-order desires (FOD), and second-order volitions (SOV). FODs are reflections of a relationship between an agent (A) and an object (X) wherein "A wants X" is a true statement. FODs do not necessarily involve A having conscious awareness of their desire for X. A SOV involves the agent having a desire for one of their FODs to be their effective will. This requires the capacity for self awareness and reflection so that one's own FOD can become an object of an "A wants X" statement. When the will of an agent is motivated by a FOV that is aligned with a SOV, then the agent acts of their own free will. This applies even in cases where an agent has a fixed nature and their actions are fully determined.</p>
        <p>Humans are not the only agents capable of having this special structure of the will. Insofar as a computer operates like a brain, it's conceivable for a robot to have this structure instantiated in their programming. Such a robot with the relevant sort of computational intelligence could relate to an object such that "A wants X" is a valid statement. This agent could also generate symbolic representations of these FODs, enabling SOVs. Both humans and robots of this kind have a central unit that processes information and sends output signals that direct action. The fact that human agents have consciousness while robotic agents do not is not a relevant consideration in the Deep Self View. Since an advanced, intelligent robot can have the relevant will structure, and cannot be denied free will for being determined, it can qualify for free will. This paper will argue that consciousness cannot be a necessary feature of compatibilist free will unless one makes problematic, metaphysical assumptions about the mind's role in delivering agency.</p>
        <h3>B. Challenge from Reductionism</h3>
        <p>I expect that one challenge raised against my reading of Frankfurt will come from the point of view that it's a bit of crude reductionism to say the brain is functionally equivalent to a CPU. In the context of agency, and in the comparison between a human and a robot, I believe the comparison is actually quite apt and important. </p>
        <p>In physics, although the relationship between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not yet understood, we have a remarkably accurate set of equations to anticipate the behavior of matter within both major frameworks. At the level described by relativity, that is above the scale of the particle, one can calculate the results of physical interactions with tremendous precision, given enough information about the objects and relevant forces. The more complicated the interactions, the less clear it is how everything is actually happening. For instance, we understand all the relevant forces involved in the flow of liquid particles, but we don't understand the dynamics involved in turbulent flow because the actions are so numerous and chaotic. Turbulence is one of the major unsolved problems in physics, but practically no one believes it involves violating known physical laws.</p>
        <p>Turbulent flow is relevant in this context because it serves as an analogy for thinking about the deterministic mechanisms of the human brain. The brain is a nonlinear system with tens of billions of neurons and as many as one hundred trillion synapses, points at which neurons communicate. Each individual neuron operates in predictable ways according to the laws of physics, and each action-potential communicates a signal to other neurons allowing information to flow at incredible speeds and volume. The constant flood of electric signals in the brain obscures attempts at interpreting how exactly the process is unfolding. But, as with turbulent flows, we should assume that the entire system is governed by the basic laws of classical physics. Just as each neuron is responding to its local conditions according to physical law, so too are the larger scale networks and systems that these neurons are organized into. The process of computing human agency may be intricate and opaque, but the rules are fixed. Furthermore, quantum indeterminacy can't have an effect on neural activity since the scale at which quantum mechanics become relevant is far too small. </p>
        <p>Now, I progress assuming the brain is a determined, mechanistic system of neurons processing information and sending signals automatically. The next important point to establish is that neural activity is the basis for all relevant human abilities and capacities. That is, all manifestations of human agency are at the direction of the agent's brain. Although it's intuitive to feel like the mind is 'doing' sense interpretation, because the world appears to us in accessible subjective images, clarity in perception and thought are enabled by subconscious neural processes that organize information into intelligible packages. For example, recognizing faces may seem like something that the mind does. I see my friend, I recognize him, and I imagine it's because I have the perception of seeing that I can recognize him. But, some people have a specific lesion in a brain region associated with visual processing that gives them a condition called visual agnosia. These individuals have no general deficit in vision, memory, or intellect but they lose the ability to recognize faces. Many of the advances that have been made in neuroscience over the last century have come from studying patients with brain damage, and the connection between neural foundations and the mind's experiences and abilities have only become more clear with the advent of FMRI technology. Today we can surmise fairly that the entire human agent is driven by the brain. The mind may be at the core of what it feels like to be a human agent, but it is not involved in hammering away at the forge. </p>
        <p>I have tried to establish that each of the events taking place in the brain are determined; the brain is a mechanistic, computational system that processes information and gives direction to its means of extension, shaping human agency. It's not a surprise that the brain is the same sort of thing as a computer, in the ways relevant for creating agency, because computers are the machines we've built to think and, increasingly, to do.</p>
        <h3>C: Consciousness and Agency</h3>
        <p>The objective of this section is to challenge the viewpoint which holds these three beliefs concurrently: (1) determinism does not preclude agents from having free will, (2) humans can have free will, (3) agents cannot have free will without consciousness. This would be a defender of the DSV who believes that consciousness plays a necessary role in free will.</p>
        <p> At the first suggestion that a robot could have free will, it may seem like something has gone wrong. It might be that the reasoning which has guided this conclusion is flawed in some fundamental way or perhaps Frankfurt just wasn't careful enough with his argument. A programmed machine can only have second-order volitions if it is (1) capable of self knowledge and (2) capable of having desires. Frankfurt is clear that a desire doesn't need to involve the agent's conscious awareness, but perhaps his implicit belief was that an unconscious desire is only a desire if it is had by an agent with the capacity to have a felt sense of desire. This would exclude robots because their desires are symbolic rather than subjective. This may be the general sentiment among compatibilists, but it's not clear to me what role consciousness is playing to advance agency in such a way as to make it a fundamental requirement for free will. </p>
        <p> Might it be the case that having a mind makes one's agency more robust in such a way that it opens up the possibility for having free will? Some attribute the presence of consciousness to darwinian forces by saying that bounded consciousness is useful to the brain in a functional way, but I am skeptical of this perspective. This seems no more likely an explanation than the idea that brains were very important for survival but neurological information processing came with an uninvited guest. In any case, it is also unclear that consciousness allows for more effective sense perception. Computers can be, and often are, programmed to interpret the same signals that make up the five human senses. There is no reason to believe the limiting factor in the further development of this technology will be the lack of mindedness.</p>
        <p>In addition to sense perception, humans have a myriad of internal conscious experiences, including emotion, thought, and intuition. Might these qualities be critically involved in the freedom of an agent? Perhaps our conscious feelings hold a unique information content that gives minded agents access to unique knowledge or abilities, but this seems like an overreach without meaningful foundations. I do believe that it makes sense to say that our conscious experiences inform our actions and shape our agency. After all, I'm saying the human brain instructs the human body to sit down and study the philosophy of mind. To me, this indicates that qualia is not merely epiphenomenal because it can inform the brain's decisions. But it would take an argument with considerable force to say that the indirect role of consciousness in agency is so important that it opens a fundamental gap between minded and non-minded agents. If anything qualia gives human agency a particular flair, but I cannot see how it makes us free. </p>
        <p>In general, I expect that supporters of compatibilism will be open to the possibility that robots can have free will because, in their view, the fact that an agent is determined does not prevent them from having free will. In Frankfurt's theory, when an agent acts according to their own reason and identifies with their action then they do so with free will. Does this really depend entirely on the agent feeling like they act freely? Surely one cannot defend the view that a person is free just because they feel like they are. If the statement, "I feel like I'm free" only needed to be true in order for the speaker to have free will, then it would dilute the concept beyond recognition. I don't think anyone seriously thinks that this is the case, but the relationship between consciousness and free will needs some explanation if true freedom and responsibility require mindedness. </p>
        <p>To be fair, my own view is that it would be patently absurd to say that a robot could actually have free will. The obvious reasoning is that a robot is fully mechanistic and shaped entirely by the forces which produce it. A robot can be no other than what it is, even if it is capable of growth or adaption these are only operations that follow from a determined script. But I can hold this position without running into a major contradiction because I also believe that it is impossible for humans to have free will for the same reason facing the robots, that our agency is the result of determined, mechanistic processes. The human brain is just another product of the evolutionary process that neither begins or ends, hopefully, with humanity. I enjoy a far greater range of freedom than other forms of life because my brain is more advanced, but we are all authored by a set of basic forces. </p>
        <p>I may not believe that consciousness is a source of freedom, but that doesn't make it unimportant. Mindedness may not be a source of power but it is a source of meaning, really it's the source of meaning. Morality has no stakes in a world with no minds, there are no tragedies on Mars. As human beings we exist, we have minds, we have abilities, and if that means having to travel along a single invisible path, then so be it. I imagine that when one takes a train along the swiss alps they are grateful for the rail which may determine their path but also gives them stable access to a stunning experience.</p>
        <h3>D The Genealogy of Free Will</h3>
        <p>Consciousness does not appear to deliver abilities to minded agents that couldn't be had or replicated by non-minded agents. If this is the case, one cannot argue that consciousness is required for free agency on the basis that it opens critical possibilities for action that can't be had without it. Both humans and advanced robots use information processing systems to deliver capabilities and drive action, and both are limited by the functional capacities programmed into their computational structures. However, there is another substantial argument that can be made to defend the special role of consciousness in qualifying an agent for free will. That is, if the mind is conceived of as a special metaphysical entity that (1) drives human agency, and (2) is not causally determined in the same way as other forces or materials. The intuition along these lines is that the mind is something like an unmoved mover. </p>
        <p>Shaun Nichols (2006) ran an experiment where the "vast majority" of subjects expressed the belief that our world involves an exception to determinism that allows for special human agency. To the extent that this sample is representative, it implies that people think there's something metaphysically special about the mind which gives human agency an exceptional quality. This is an assumption that I think is being made almost anytime the idea of free will is being advocated for. In the case of a compatibilist who fundamentally rejects the possibility that a robot could have free will, I think the implicit assumption that the mind plays a special metaphysical role in delivering agency is the reason they would refuse my claim. I say it's an implicit assumption because it's not the sort of position a compatibilist wants to defend, but I do think it's an important part of what a person wants when they choose to believe in free will.</p>
        <p>Should we be surprised if this sort of assumption is widely held but seldom discussed? Metaphysical notions about the nature of consciousness have historically been at the center of free will as an idea. When debates about free will first emerged and became relevant discourses in western civilization, what it meant to have free will was to have a mind with directive properties that give it a special metaphysical status in the universe. This status was needed in Christian theology to avoid a God who makes people exactly the way that they are and then puts them in circumstances which will inevitably result in their eternal damnation. Free will entered the chat because the church needed to say that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own sins. The doctrine of free will directly implied individual responsibility for one's actions in a way that justified punishment. This claim involved the idea that humans have a soul which, along with the properties of being immortal and immaterial, is directing the body in such a way that the soul itself is responsible for a person's agency. In contemporary philosophy the discourse has secularized and we refer to the mind instead of the soul, but have we left behind the metaphysical implications or have they snuck on board? It's not a surprise that today the discourse still centers around the question of whether we have the kind of free will that justifies moral desert. Perhaps one should also not be surprised that the idea of free will has retained the core, metaphysical aspect of its original iteration, despite being moved into a non-theistic discipline.</p>
        <p>In the early modern period when this theistic dualism was ideologically dominant, the idea of a homunculus was used to understand the nature of the mind-brain relationship. Latin for "little man," the homunculus was imagined as a small person in the brain that is holding all the strings like a marionette puppeteer. It implies that what "I" am is a spiritual being that is directing the brain and animating the body. Without evidence to the contrary, this is a very natural thing to believe because it coheres with our intuitive, subjective experience of agency. The mind feels that it is in control. If someone asked me about my pitching delivery, I could walk them through a series of motions explaining how "I" throw the baseball. It feels that "I", meaning my mind, am initiating and executing the sequence each time through conscious body movements: mind (giving directions) → brain (giving directions) → body. This intuition reflects the notion of the homunculus. </p>
        <p>When these ideas about the soul and the homunculus were intellectually reputable in western society, nobody had any idea how the brain worked. Without the privilege of experimental data, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the brain works in ways that reflect our subjective experience of mind driven agency. In a different world, one could imagine that when scientists started learning about the brain they could have found a system that reinforces these intuitions. Such a brain could still look a lot like ours, with networks of electric signals running through neurons, but with a touch of mystery. Imagine that all the signals could be traced back to one critically important node that sends information but seems to receive it from nowhere. Maybe this is what Descartes expected to find when he suggested the pineal gland was the seat of consciousness. This mysterious, top down system in the brain would perhaps not imply but certainly indicate the possibility of special metaphysical consciousness of the relevant sort. The mind seems tethered into one, that is we experience bound phenomenology, so it's fair that people assumed a centralized, top down brain. Unfortunately, and unintuitively, this is not what scientists have found. Under the hood, the human brain is a wet, lumpy, and incredibly dense distributed system of biological wires. With the power of a lightbulb, this mass can compute as much information/second as the world’s most powerful supercomputer can do with the electricity demand of 30,000 American homes. The brain is an epic, decentralized mess. There is no center, no home for the homunculus.</p>
        <h3>E: Conclusion & Future Direction</h3>
        <p>Frankfurt was involved in describing a notion of free will that can exist alongside determinism and mechanistic agency, as I've described them. As such, he recognized that determinism places real limitations on human freedom. Identification can imply free will only if one becomes content with the limited sort of freedom that is allowed by the nature of their being and so they choose to define the freedom they have as free will. "Suppose that (a person) enjoys both freedom of action and freedom of the will. Then he is not only free to do what he wants to do; he is also free to want what he wants to want. It seems to me that he has, in that case, all the freedom that is possible to desire or to conceive.”
        <p>The appeal of self awareness and identification in Frankfurt's theory is that it allows us to say that we are free in the moments where we feel like it, when we do what we really want, and to say others are free in the actions that we want to hold them responsible for, when they act without effective coercion. The DSV resonates because it places free will in the situations where we feel like it applies. But, this approach loses that intuitive appeal if a person has to accept that Frankfurtian free will is a thing that machines can have. In one sense, that may be because it shows his concept of free will doesn't require much actual freedom in the agent. As long as the agent identifies with their will, they are said to have free will. If the desire that the agent identifies with is planted in them, or otherwise determined externally, it doesn't make them less free. The second sense, why I think others would be strongly averse to this supposition, is because robots don't have minds and believers in free will tend to assume that mindedness must be involved. I've attempted to demonstrate that robots can be programmed to have the same sort of functional agency that humans have, only lacking mindedness. The challenge, then, to a person who believes in free will but thinks it is available to humans and not robots, is to explain what actual role the mind plays in creating true freedom and responsibility.  </p>
        <p>The sort of free will that would satisfy the individual who wants the mind to be involved, but doesn't expect that mindedness is able to deliver abilities that a computer couldn't replicate procedurally, is the idea of free will that was invented by Christian theologians to cover up a contradiction in their doctrine. It does assume the mind is playing an active role which is the reason a person can say they have true responsibility. Outside of this interpretation, free will doesn't make sense, it was never made to make sense, it was made to be an unquestioned extension of authority from the theological hegemon.</p>
        <p>What should be done with the concept of free will, then? To philosophers, I recommend leaving it alone and allowing the theological conception to remain, as I think it deceptively has, the true meaning of the term. Some will say free will is a reality and some will say it's an impossibility, but at least they will be talking about the same thing. Vargas (2007) suggests revising the meaning of free will so that it fits more neatly in our world, but I think this is unhelpful at best and deceptive at worst. Revisionism involves taking a commonly known concept (free will) that signifies a thing that is commonly desired (true responsibility) and suggests replacing the meaning that people want with a different idea, one that is obscure and contested. But, people want the sort of free will that is implied in the theological notion. If a restaurant customer asks for a Coca-Cola and is given an RC Cola in a Coke can, don't expect them to feel satisfied with the restaurant's sleight of hand. If the restaurant doesn't carry Coke products, they should just be upfront about it. </p>
        </p> What needs to be done is not to mess around with the conceptualization of free will but to simply walk away from it. Philosophers should be concerned with constructing a practical moral responsibility in the world that they actually live in rather than trying to profess or resist ideas about free will and ultimate responsibility.</p>
