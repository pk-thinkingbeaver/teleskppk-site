     I wrote this after spending 3 weeks sleeping and working in my childhood basement, and it became the impetus for seeking out a philosophy MA. I think it was a few days after I wrote this that I found MAPH which has the double conveinence of being a pulse check(book) admission and in the city where the homies live. Some of this stuff is going to get a rearticulation in my next paper, but it's more like a beginner's painting than a reflection of my exact commitments. Some things in here are more important than others, but it's missing much more than it has.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>For the sake of thought, 'abstract society' can be conceptualized as a system of human cooperation and interaction which is sufficiently large to make direct relations between people impossible[1]. For instance, in a community of 100 I could meaningfully recognize everyone, know basic information about them, have a sense of how to interact with them, and so on[2]. In a society of 1,000,000, the community of relationships that I do have is a miniscule fraction of the larger social web. Within this context, two things will always be true for a typical person: they directly interact with only a small section of the system and the system is almost entirely composed of strangers.</p>
<p>When I refer to 'the system' I am referring to a particular form of abstract society among many possibilities between which there is substantial variability. All abstract societies have had three defining features which are necessary for the system's stability and are meaningfully distinct from one another, although their relationships to each other are interdependent with bidirectional influence. These three essential features are economy, culture, and politics. While that's not exactly a revelation, it's important to consider the differences between the abstract societies which have these qualities, growing out of agriculture, formal civilization and empire, with those in the deep past.</p>
<p>Our species, Homo Sapiens, have survived on earth for approximately 200,000 years. We know from Archaeology and Anthropology that human societies in the era of hunting and gathering were small and had many important distinctions from our modern, abstract societies. People were familiar with each other and could observe and understand how their community operated simply by participating in it. The modern distinctions between culture, economy, and society are not meaningful in this context other than to an observer who comes from an abstract society and automatically tries to fit unfamiliar practices within the preformed concepts and in relation to their own experiences. However, in ancestral societies these features are not meaningfully distinct like they are in our society, in Ancient Greece, Imperial China, etcetera. The dynamic of a collaborative network in which people knew each other, understood how their system works, and in which the spheres we commonly understand as culture, economics, and politics are fused, I will refer to as a relational society.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the above point, let's consider an example of the Kilivila people in Papua New Guinea, which was operating as a relational society without the imposition of western power as recently as the early 20th century. The people of this society not only knew each other but truly livedwitheach other. That doesn't mean they had meetings once a day then went off and worked by themselves. It doesn't mean they all lived miles away from each other in suburban homes, seeing each other at infrequent events and celebrations. I mean they collaborated and interacted on a daily basis for the entirety of their lives. In their society, there were certain individuals of high reputation known as Tabuya. When Western Anthropologists first studied and wrote about these individuals, they interpreted their role through the idea of a chief, which is a westernized concept that creates a false analogy to figures of power and authority in abstract societies. These early researchers could only understand the complex and multi-varied role of the Tabuya by referring to their importance in economic, cultural, and political activity, which were distinct categories to them but not to the Kilivila.</p>
<p>From a Western perspective, it would have been hard to imagine someone with as much relevance to their society without assuming they imposed power on the community, directly or indirectly. With enough economic or political capital in a Western nation, a person can shape the world around them in a myriad of ways, limited only by their will and the extent of their capital. This line of reasoning is the extension of an assumption that the society of the Kilivila people could be understood with the same pyramidal hierarchy scheme as underlies abstract societies, from (some older empire) to the Roman Empire, to the United States. Now, in the late 20th century Anthropologists started to discuss the termreverse dominance hierarchyto account for the deviation between the structure of a society like the Kilivila and the modern nation state. In a reverse dominance hierarchy, attempts by individuals to assert power or dominance are actively checked and neutralized by the collective group, ensuring a more egalitarian and cooperative social structure.</p>
<p>Such was the case for the Kilivila. The Tabuyas of their societies were not modified versions of Bill Clinton or Warren Buffet, their relevance came from a reputation among the people who revered them as manifesting the values of the culture and community. The legitimacy and respect afforded to a Tabuya was closely linked to their ability to act wisely, generously, and justly. Without these qualities, they could not maintain their status and influence. This role, variations of which are commonly found in other relational societies, is about persuasion, consensus-building, and effectiveredistributionof resources rather than autocratic control. We can better understand the logic that organizes these systems by comparing how one might think about a particular action. Rather than asking themselves what they might gain from a certain behavior, as we expect in western society, in a reverse hierarchy people are more likely to ask themselves 'what will this mean for my relationships.' So, activities that we might think of as economic or political in nature were in fact primarily relational.</p>
<p>Modern abstract societies, which are defined most organized by the forces of transnational capitalism, also typically involve a parliamentary government, could hardly be more different than theautonomusrelational societies of the past. Still, these are two variations of the same fundamental concept of a society. We need to live in communities one way or another because we are not solitary animals. Our genetic adaptations are specifically oriented towards survival in a group context.</p>
<p>If we are not truly an independent species but are interdependent, then our societies must be the vehicles through which we can solve problems together that would be intractable for everyone to manage on their own. Let's say that any system that is able to sufficiently address the problem set and produce stability within its own structures can be considered a solution. Both abstract and relational societies have proven capable of solving basic problems that face human beings and their groups. For the vast majority of our species, we lived across the globe in different forms of relational societies. But, after the agricultural revolution everything changed. Whether they were militarily dominated, coerced from their familiar lands, or tempted into becoming full time food cultivators over the course of many generations, hunter gatherer societies began fading into the periphery.</p>
<p>Although we're lucky to have documented accounts from relational societies to learn from, our world is clearly dominated by abstract societies with capitalist economies, parliamentary governments, and a wide range of cultures across regions of the world. Abstract society is a fact of life in the 21st century, and it will continue to be a fact of life until, one hypothetical day, the world has changed in so many ways that I can't imagine it from my desk in 2024. So, for now, we're strapped with this particular sort of society - one where people don't know each other and we only interact with a small portion of the society's operative systems through our economic, political, and cultural roles. With such a broad conception, there are a lot of different ways that such a society can be arranged. I will argue that they are not all equally desirable and that it is very important for people to think critically of how our society needs to be different in order to improve its outcomes relative to fundamental moral goalposts.</p>
<p>How could we possibly compare two societies in order to say which might be "better" than the other? The very process of conducting an evaluation requires a set of criteria determined by whoever is making the judgment, and so wouldn't the spectrum of good and bad be a reflection of the judge's preferences, implicit or otherwise?  I think this is generally true. Of course, modern Western society is built upon the invasion and economic exploitation of colonialism, which was always (dishonestly) justified by referencing the need for a 'civilizing force' provided by the great nations to the weak and backwards. So, even this line of reasoning is suspect. To avoid these errors and associations, we're going to look at benchmarks that are very broad and agreeable.</p>
<p>Taking for granted that a particular society is able to consistently solve the basic problems we face as humans, we can evaluate it based on whether the individuals in that society are able to (1) meet the general population's material needs (2) meet the general population's psycho-emotional needs (3) the general population can expect 1 and 2 reliably for the future (4) at a broad scale the society can maintain these standards through sustainable conduct.</p>
<p>The third distinction is important when comparing two people who might otherwise have similar indicators on these fronts but between whom there is a massive gap[3]. On the one hand, a person who is fed, housed, and clothed their entire lives but lives with modest accommodations would live a very different life depending on whether they could expect these needs to be met in their future or if they were constantly threatened with destitute conditions such as houselessness. In the latter case, missing work, getting sick, or having an emergency could have put them on the street. The second person may live a life made miserable (or at least unenjoyable) by fear and worry despite having their basic needs met. The experience of instability represents an important bridge between a person's material life and their psycho-emotionalstates[a].</p>
<p>When the gaps in these fundamental variables are wide between societies, the difference is moral in character because it relates to an unjustified distinction in human quality of life[4]. If one society is able to maintain itself but the individuals within it are barely fed, highly isolated, or otherwise fearful of impending crisis. And, if another society is able to maintain itself but the individuals generally have the things they need, feel connected to one another, and have faith that the future will be stable, then the significant qualitative difference between these solutions becomes moral in character. It would be immoral to impose the former solution onto a population when the latter could be arranged.</p>
<p>To illustrate the moral relevancy of comparing different solutions to the human problem set, let's consider the example of an ancient abstract society - The Roman Empire. To this day in western society, the Roman Empire is glorified for its power, innovation, and efficiency. Indeed, the Roman legal code laid the foundation of all modern states in the west, and that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of influence. The Roman Empire was nothing if not stable, lasting for ~500 years and continuing for another 1000 in the Byzantine era. But, it would be exceedingly difficult to defend the position that the Roman ruling class was interested in the wellbeing of the populus, outside of whatever had implications for maintaining their power. Their solution to fueling a remarkably vast and stable empire depended on forceful and violent control of workers. "According to the estimates made by Keith Hopkins, at the end of the first century BCE the empire contained approximately two million slaves out of a total population of six million[5]." It suffices to say that slavery was a necessary and defining feature of the Roman economy.</p>
<p>We don't need a slavery based economic system in order to operate an economy capable of maintaining a stable society. This is the scale at which our comparisons are reasonable. All things equal, it would be desirable to live in a society that does a better job of meeting the needs of more people. If one could choose whether to be born into a random position within the Roman Empire or within the United States and its territories, it would certainly be in one's self interest to choose the latter. Despite claims about The End of History with the collapse of the Soviet Union, I am interested if a similar moral imperative exists between the contemporary US system of Capitalism, Parliamentarianism, and our general cultural system which is not the same everywhere but generally organizes around individualism and consumerism.</p>
<p>Clearly, the differences between living in 37 CE Rome or 2024 CE United States is not just a difference in laws and economic structure, but also the massive difference in society's technological state. The industrial revolution, which made economic production more efficient than was previously imaginable, and the scientific revolution, which unlocked powers that were previously reserved for the gods and warlocks of mythology. So, if abstract societies organized around Capitalism have been responsible for advances in production and technology, what impetus could we find for the claim that the difference between some currently undefined set of social structures could seem as significant a change as a world with electricity and self-ownership represents when compared to an empire built on the bloodshed of military conquest and slavery?</p>
<p>There are at least two clear sources - calcification of poverty and class society & impending collapse of life supporting ecological systems. Presenting a full argument that explains why the economic and environmental conditions are so concerning and central to the existing power structure will require a very lengthy and detailed explanation, which is not the point of this paper. For now, it suffices to say that our current societies are driving ecological changes that are going to havegenocidalconsequences for people in vulnerable communities across the world today and for all of humanity that will inherit the world once we're all gone. Billions of lives will be tortured and ended as a result of extreme weather, sea level rise, and falling agricultural productivity. Members of the economic elite have predicted these outcomes for roughly 75 years and members of the political elite have been aware for nearly 50 years[6]. That nothing has been or is going to be done by the nations of the world is not a historical accident or the result of a few bad apples in the system, but is representative of a broader power structure. Additionally, capitalism has proven to be very limited in its ability to extend economic benefits broadly across society. In the United States, after the post war miracle, the trend is towards higher prices and stagnating incomes. Poverty and economic instability are rampant globally, and circumstances are only going to get more unstable.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the advancement of industrial machinery meant humans were increasingly being replaced by physical capital rather than supplementing them. In the 21st century, we can expect computational technology to outperform human cognition in a large number of roles. The trends that point towards ecological devastation and economic stagnation are long standing and are primed to continue.</p>
<p>Regardless of one's knowledge relating to the specifics of climate science and macroeconomic trends, it should be agreeable that the abolition of poverty and the achievement of sustainability would represent a magnitudinal shift in the quality of our society. The "yes but" that a typical person might furnish in response to the preceding statement would focus on feasibility. Yes, it would be better if everyone could reliably expect to meet their own needs and still have time and capacity to live freely. But, if everyone expects to be taken care of then nobody is going to work. Yes, we want to live in a way that doesn't undermine the life supporting systems of the planet. But, without fossil fuels all economic activity will collapse, poverty will expand, everything will be worse, and the planet willstill warm. Both points can be addressed, but for now I would say to anyone who feels inclined towards them to suspend their disbelief for the sake of argument. If these challenges are indeed insurmountable, then the discussion ends here. But, if a society were capable of ending poverty, achieving sustainability, and making improvements on psych-emotional wellbeing (which would partially be a result of these other outcomes) then it would represent a massive improvement to society. A paradigm shift so life changing and fundamental that most people wouldn't even entertain the possibility, but that's all I'm asking for. To accept at face value that such a societywouldrepresent a categorical improvement from an objective moral point of view.</p>
<p>My interest in political philosophy pertains to the investigation of whether such a paradigm shift in society, which I believe would have to be economic, political, and cultural in nature, is conceivable under the condition that people would be willing to support it, which for the sake of my project is being depended upon whether this new structure is desirable.</p>
<p>Certainly, I think capitalist parliamentarianism is not the rational end of political and social progress. It is a common misconception for a person to believe that the world around them has an essential quality that would make significant deviations from it impossible to imagine. We naturalize the circumstances that seem natural to us, and I am willing to bet this impulse has been with us for a long time before the beginning of history. I expect that 15,000 years ago, if a member of a relational society began telling stories of how millions of people would live together in one society under the imaginative power of paper notes, it would have been unimaginable. The economies of Athens in the Classical Age and the Roman Empire were based on slavery, and involved an ideology which naturalized slavery as an inevitable fact of human life. If we make a habit out of assuming that what it will always be, then we have to admit such a tendency will manifest as bias against considering or exploring necessary changes. If this is the general current of thought in society, then I am prepared to swim upstream. If others follow, they may find that it was the force of everyone's movement that kept things going in a particular direction, and once they turned to swim the opposite way they found the current just as agreeable.</p>
<p>If philosophy is not about challenging dominant norms and assumptions for the sake of moving towards relevant truths, however unintuitive or seeminglyunrealistic, then I have no interest in it. But, if it is a space to learn the skills of rigorous analysis, logic, and argumentation in the service of moving in the aspirational direction of truth, then it is where I want to be. In the 1970s, John Rawls and Robert Nozick wrote landmark books in political philosophy on the nature of a just society. BothA Theory of JusticeandAnarchy, State, and Utopiahave shown me the value of discussing the fundamentals of society and exploring the possibilities for a better world, which each of them believed their works to be in the direction of. My project is to explore novel formulations of economics, politics, and culture which are both compatible with each other, are compatible with human nature, which achieve the results discussed earlier, and could be seen as desirable from the perspective of someone living in any society today.</p>
<p>Although I have not yet had the opportunity to fully explore research and writing as my primary function, I am not yet a philosopher, my current thought has led me towards a general conception which could describe, in loose terms, the skeleton for a novel formulation of society that is designed to meet the requirements I've set above. At the core of this adolescent theory is the idea that cooperation, properly organized, is not only advantageous for the collective, it can and should be so for the individual as well. In fact, I believe that perhaps the strongest guide in determining human behavior was the emotions and psychology which would allow for egalitarian group cooperation at the relational level, and that because we maintain our genetics, emotions, and psychology, that this capacity of individuals to benefit from cooperation at the local level can be the foundation upon which a new sort of society can be built. My conception of a new set of social structures is not itself entirely novel, but rather is a sort of dialectical synthesis between relational and abstract societies which have existed to this point.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I will describe 5 core features which a society might have in order to achieve the goals set forth in the introduction: constructive values, economic baseline, remuneration by contribution, systemically inherent communities, and sustainability. In order to provide a broad context for these ideas, I will begin by describing a dynamic that I believe is at the center of effective relational societies and which should be incorporated into the structure of our abstract societies.</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Exchange</h3>
<p>It is not controversial to say that human beings have physical needs and psycho-emotional needs, but might we wonder why such a statement isn't purely redundant? Why is it that we have psycho-emotional needs that can be meaningfully distinct from our physical needs, in other words why is it that the way we feel can be easily separated from whether we have what we need to survive? According to evolutionary theory, and verifiable through introspection, our emotional responses are adaptive mechanisms that serve to regulate behavior. The reason that so many of our emotional experiences and psychological patterns can be so detached from our satisfied physical needs is because our emotional system is not just trying to get us to eat and sleep, they are fundamentally trying to push us towards being meaningfully accepted in our communities/society.</p>
<p>In the age of industrial production, computer technology, and space travel, among other things, we are likely to see intelligence as the defining quality of our species. But, Homo Sapiens lived for 200,000 years without calculators, electricity, or even written language. We were intelligent and knowledgeable, having learned from our elders, but more importantly we were able to live and function as a group. To fit into community, to be accepted, respected, and cared for by others, is as much filling a need for the human emotional system as having a full meal fills the need of our physical body and satisfied our psycho-emotional drive for food[7]. It would have been very dangerous to be abandoned from one's tribe for violating the group's norms or rejecting its values, so it should be unsurprising that we still fear being socially ostracized, even if it wouldn't stop us from going to work the next day or picking up groceries.</p>
<p>Our emotional systems have adapted to help us participate in what I'm callingThe Fundamental Exchange, which describes the mediation of physical and emotional needs between each individual and their relational group. Broadly, and in terms we can easily understand[8], the individual contributes their labor into the system and their product is shared in a common pool. The individual receives a share of what everyone has produced in common in order to meet their own physical needs. Correspondingly, the group fulfills the individual's psycho-emotional needs. This can be seen as a compounding of their experience as a valued member of the community (1:many), their experience of close friendships between other members (1:1), and by having time for leisure[9].</p>
<p>[Diagram]</p>
<p>In addition to the direct value of external relationships, the individual's internal sense of self-worth or self-esteem is also largely influenced by how they feel about their role/value/significance to the society around them. In the individualistic culture of the United States, we think of this in terms of status, the (explicit) pursuit of which carries a negative connotation. But, feeling good about a person's value/role in their society is a natural and healthy emotional response when they are actually doing good things that are valuable to other people (as I claim is a present condition in the fundamental exchange). In the United States, the sources of a person's pride are seldom tied to what they're doing for other people or society and more often tied to their place in perceived social hierarchies. For example, if a person feels good about themselves because they think they're more intelligent than other people, their sense of self esteem is not about how they're using their intelligence in a way that is helpful, ethical, or otherwise good. Rather, it's because they believe themselves to be in a dominant position within an imagined hierarchy of their identified peers[10]that they believe exists not only in their minds but in others. The social basis of self esteem, which reflects the values we see in our societies, is a very positive thing when those values are socially constructive. There is a tremendous amount that can be said on this subject, both to defend and sufficiently explain it. For now, the general assertion is that our relationships to others and to the values implicit in our culture have a tremendous influence on our psycho-emotional wellbeing. The general explanation for this pattern is that our evolutionary adaptations have been programmed for operating in relational societies, where being included and valued by the group was indispensable for survival.</p>
<p>The fundamental exchange within relational societies involved the production and distribution of necessary goods and services without explicit calculation of value or immediate return. This operating state is known to anthropologists as the gift economy. These dynamics were extended beyond mere transactional exchange; it was about maintaining relationships, ensuring mutual survival, and fostering social bonds. Again, we can better understand these activities by seeing them as relational rather than economic in the modern sense. For instance, forthe !KungSan of the Kalahari desert, sharing a successful hunt's yield wasn't just about distributing food, it was also about reinforcing social ties and obligations. Their culture included a norm where the community would sarcastically mock individuals who were proficient hunters in order to prevent them from feeling overly prideful or important. The hunter knew everyone appreciated him because if he were not performing exceptionally, and if the group were not benefiting a lot from his hunting, then they wouldn't bother mocking him. The hunter can feel appreciated while staying humble and the community can remain egalitarian despite an imbalance in the distribution of ability (Cite). One of my close friends in high school was the best football player and the best baseball player, but our friend group used to sarcastically call him "Mr. Average" to the same effect. We didn't start doing this because we learned about the practice in the book, it came out organically.</p>
<p>In order for the fundamental exchange to functionally operate in a society, there needs to be particular social norms and cultural values to mediate the relationship between the individual and the group, as we see inthe !KungSan example. While there must be a number of distinct values that allow for balance between the individual and the group, the central value is reciprocity. In evolutionary biology, the term refers to mechanisms whereby the evolution of cooperative behavior is favored by the probability of future mutual interactions (wikipedia). But, it's not something humans do as the result of a conscious, deliberative process. It is something that animates us intuitively under the right conditions, namely with people we have relationships with whom we value. We still do this today in our abstract societies, and often feel good about the ability to help a person who has either helped you before or who you care about. That it occurs without explicit reference to morality is a testament to the fact that reciprocity is an important and natural feature of interpersonal activity which is meant to promote the health and durability of the community, even if we don't think about our reciprocal behavior in those terms. In egalitarian relational societies, the norms about fairness, sharing, and the proper way to treat others which governs "economic" interactions can be seen as facilitating this reciprocal system in order to ensure individual's needs are being met and therefore that the group itself is healthy.</p>
<p>As Graeber and Warnock demonstrated, there is considerable diversity between relational societies in terms of their values, norms, and practices. Take, for example, (two contemporary societies in the Pacific Northwest) one was more authoritarian and the other more egalitarian. In the former, individuals are more signing a social contract that accepts their role in the society they are born into and the latter the individuals all benefit from things being this way, and so it is more like the fundamental exchange than a begrudging decision made for mutual protection, as Hobbes saw the social contract. While all individuals in both societies embraced their way of living, from an outside view one can say they would prefer to live intheegalitarian society. The fundamental exchange, then, is not a universal rule for relational human societies but it does reflect an effective strategy that promotes individual and collective well being without allowing for the concentration and imposition of power.</p>
<p>From this point forward, I will sketch out a few structural features of society that could make it possible for abstract societies to incorporate the features of relational societies which were effective at meeting everyone's needs but lacked the complexity and technological advancement that define our postmodern age. [constructive values, economic baseline, remuneration by contribution, systemically inherent communities, and sustainability]</p>
<h3>Constructive Values</h3>
<p>In her bookThe Grammar of Society, Philosopher Christine Bicchieri explains that "we need social norms in place where there is conflict of interest but also the opportunity for joint gain" (3).[11]From a broad point of view, the opportunity to base society on cooperation rather than competition represents exactly such a possibility. As such, the role of social norms is indispensable in order to create alignment between individuals and the community at large. These norms can't be arbitrary, imposed by a central authority (ruling minority), or strongly in conflict with what individuals want for themselves. In order for norms to create and sustain alignment in a way thatsimulates the fundamental exchange[b], they have to be based on values that members of society agree about and which are well integrated within the prevailing culture. I posit that an abstract system based on cooperation can thrive on the cultural basis ofconstructive values, which are values that contribute to the wellbeing of individuals and society.</p>
<p>The essence of constructive values is represented in the paradigm shift between providing social status to an individual based on their individual achievements/pursuits of narrow economic interest and replacing it with basing reputation on what a person does for other people. When the latter is the centerpiece of our value system, it is not only good for society because people are choosing to do more for others but it also is more rewarding for the individual who finds meaningful connections in their reciprocal activities. This is not the same as saying that from a utilitarian perspective a person should always do what's good for someone else, because that sort of rule is self defeating and so could never naturally guide behavior. If we are going to have values that are good for society, they have to be good for the individual such that actions in alignment with those values will be freely chosen by a wide variety of actors.</p>
<p>Through the fundamental exchange, individuals gain respectability based on their contributions to society when they align with the prevailing culture and values. As I discussed in the last section in relation to the social basis of self esteem, how our actions are evaluated within the framework of dominant social values has a strong influence on what we choose to do and how we feel about it. As such, society is well served when the value system links reputation and self esteem to the things people do for others. When a person is evaluated by their society based on what they contribute to their communities rather than what they do in pursuit of their own narrow economic self-interest. The fundamental point is that we want our values to create alignment between the psycho-emotional needs of the individual and the needs of the society, to be an engine of economic and cultural activity. Although we're not going to know everyone in an abstract society the way people did in their relational societies, we can still strive to secure for the same basic dynamic that is present in the fundamental exchange. To do so, we must take advantage of the fact that the individual needs to be valued by their community and put it to use in a way that brings us back to the reason such a need was evolutionarily adaptive, because it was good for the group.</p>
<p>In the United States status/reputation is closely tied to individual achievement. Individual achievement is typically correlative to a person's relative position in relevant social and economic hierarchies. A person who attends Harvard Business school perceives themselves, and is perceived by others as, as having higher standing than someone who went to the University of Illinois. An elementary school teacher is given less respect than an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. While status is both a cause and an effect of the desirability of a person's position, the main link is through the acquisition of wealth which people desire. But,US society inflates the value of wealth as a contributor to wellbeing.</p>
<p>One reason for this attitude among the general public is because people who struggle economically identify wealth as the thing that would save them from stress and suffering, as such it can take on a transcendent quality in their minds.People often imagine the lives of the richare not only free of suffering but practically free of worry and discomfort. After all, why wouldn't they be? The wealthy truly are safe from the existential fears that working class people are forced to manage. But, the omission of intense negative experiences, such as stress over basic resources, does not imply an inclusion of things that give a person the sense that their life is good, that they want things to be happening the way they are, that they really appreciate the day to day, etcetera. Often, people who pursue wealth relentlessly find they have neglected many of their fundamental social needs running up the hedonic treadmill.A very rich person, according to common intuition, is more enviable than someone who has their needs covered but is deeply tied to the people in their lives. I believe this is an inversion of values, and that people will be better off if the dominant culture were to guide them towards social connectivity and expression rather than material gain or status in an abstract sense which is distinct from reputation in a relational context.</p>
<p>This requires an intentional shift in the values we want to promote in our social networks and in society at large. Namely, what values can be in place that will create the foundation for cultural norms and expectations which will facilitate economic cooperation and cultural connectivity - help us meet our physical and emotional needs. In a lot of ways, people in any given culture are constantly trying to do this. Take masculinity, in US culture men have traditionally been encouraged to deny the emotional aspect of their experiences, equating emotional vulnerability with weakness. But, now there is a wide effort among individuals to challenge this feature of culture which works against our needs and wellbeing. Many people also recognize that changing aspects of our culture to improve society on an individual level or on a broader systemic level is a valuable thing to do. Someone might choose to be a vegetarian even though they don't have enough market power in our society to stop the systematic abuse of livestock animals, their choices can send a signal to others which can lead to a society reconsidering their relationship to norms of eating meat. Of course, when a person challenges norms there is often backlash from ardent followers. In American culture, there is a negative stereotypical image of the lecturing, annoying vegan but there is not an equivalent for a person who is indifferent towards the suffering of pigs, cows, chickens, and lamb that would make participating in the meat-industrial complex socially stigmatized. But, in all likelihood, there is a critical mass that could be reached where this dynamic would shift.</p>
<p>Some cultural shifts, such as away from toxic masculinity or towards respecting animals rights, can happen without a necessary shift in the economic or political systems. Other aspects of culture are more directly tied to the other major spheres of abstract society. It would likely be the case that in order to replace income or wealth at the center of our culture's value set, there needs to be a corresponding shift in economic structures such that one's profession is no longer the dominant feature of their identity and time on Earth. I believe most people would assume this sort of shift is so impossible that it's not even worth thinking about. If they are correct, allow me to be the one whose dedication to a hopeless philosophical pursuit proves their point. For now, I am convinced that Capitalist individualism is more of a trap that humanity is stuck in rather than an honest expression of our fundamental nature. Locke and Smith might have helped move western society from Monarchist-Mercantilism to Parliamentary-Capitalism, but with any luck we're not at the end of history. Perhaps this system can be replaced by one that is more community oriented and which facilitates economic cooperation and vibrant community life. The questions related to executing production and managing distribution would obviously need to be addressed. What features may be present in an economy that is built for stability, sufficiency, and just distribution in contrast to our current which is driven entirely by growth and the need to incentivize private capital investments? A full response can't possibly fit here, but we can start by thinking broadly about important features such as cooperation, motivation, and remuneration.</p>
<h3>Infinite Growth Paradox[12]</h3>
<p>Capitalism is an economic system which is driven by private investment, private ownership of capital, wage-labor, and market based determination of prices. In order to continually attract private investment, the system itself must experience annual increases in total expenditures - what we call economic growth. The only reason that individuals and corporations invest their private financial capital in economic activity is because they expect to experience a return on their investment, a process which can only happen in the context of macroeconomic growth.</p>
<p>In a process best understood in the framework of Minsky's theory of financial fragility, Capitalism experiences periods of contraction when investors stop, expenditures begin to fall, and more investors stop injecting money into the system. Like a shark that will fall to the bottom of the ocean if it stops swimming, the contracting economy drives society into a crisis. Money stops flowing throughout the economy, people lose their jobs, lose their homes, and so on. Within this system, every region of the economy is deeply interconnected. Importantly, the production and distribution of essential vs non-essential vs luxury goods and services all depend on each other. When a recession is triggered by insufficient demand in a few related sectors, then people who work in entirely different sectors would lose their economic stability, facing layoffs and evictions. Demand for what economists call inferior goods will rise, which corresponds to a shift in consumer spending towards thrifty options, but that only means people are functionally bracing themselves for a crisis.</p>
<p>Recessions make it clear just how much everyone in society needs the economy to be growing in a Capitalist economy. Of course, the engine of growth is fueled by private companies who pursue their own expansion, in the service of their shareholders. These companies are built to be sociopathic in nature, considering only their own profitability and growth without any institutional morality, beyond peripheral concerns over branding. The justification for allowing private interests to pursue profitability at the expense of any and all other values is the idea that the government, acting in the interest of society, is able to set restrictions and regulations on corporate behavior so they can pursue profits without infringing on collective interests or rights.</p>
<p>In practice, private economic activity is largely unchecked by governments which are effectively financed by their growth, who wield international influence based on the size of the domestic economy, and whose politicians are funded and lobbied by private interests. In the United States, dominant sectors/corporations within the domestic economy are not structurally redirected to align corporate behavior with the public interest. If anything governments typically support corporate expansion efforts in the hopes of accelerating economic growth across the economy. This alignment is reflected in the global response to climate change. Unchecked economic activity in G20 economies is responsible for over 90% of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, the Paris Agreement was signed with goals to keep global warming from eclipsing 2 degrees C. Since them, emissions have continued along the "business as usual" trajectory which according to the IPCC will lead to over 4 degrees C warming by 2100, with much more in store after that[13]. For the purposes of this paper, it suffices to say that the effect of such extreme global warming will be disastrous across the globe. In particular areas that are both densely populated and highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as the Ganges River Delta, 4 degrees warming over time is nothing short ofapocalyptic.</p>
<p>Opponents of strong government regulations, not only relating to climate but in all areas, argue that restricting economic activity will lead to a dampening of growth or the onset of a recession. This argument, which has merit when considering the possibility of structural changes or significant restrictions on macroeconomic activity, is at the core of capitalism's infinite growth paradox. In our modern Capitalist societies, both economic growth and contraction produce existential threats. To use human anatomy for the sake of comparison, perpetual growth creates cancer as production overwhelms life supporting systems while the end of growth leads to a sort of cardiac arrest, where resources no longer flow throughout society. Cancer in this context can be global in scale, such as the overproduction and bioaccumulation of plastics, the destruction of forests, the overuse of groundwater systems, or the erosion of topsoil, or it can be local. I organized in a community in East St. Louis, Missouri that was in the shadow of a hazardous waste incinerator that was spewing toxic metals such as lead, arsenic, and beryllium into the community without having to track or reduce their emissions. The government was unresponsive to calls for the plant's emissions to be regulated, and self regulation was obviously opposed to the corporation's financial interest.</p>
<p>Functionally, citizens are forced to accept broader economic forces as beyond their control or influence[14]. This extends beyond the exogenous effects of economic activity, such as the ecological impact or depletion of resources, and relates to endogenous dynamics that are also painting a bleak picture for the future of work. For the vast majority of people, the value and negotiating power of their wage-labor determines their income. Valuable work but low leverage, such as undocumented agricultural work in California, means low wages. Valuable work and high leverage, like being a machine learning engineer, leads to higher wages. In addition to the fact that unions in the United States have been on the decline for decades, leading to less leverage, there is a more structural challenge in the labor market that is putting downward pressure on the upper bound for wages in the working class, creating a crisis of stability.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20th century, advancements in manufacturing technology meant that physical labor has been increasingly unable to compete with machine labor, except in places where companies can employ workers at poverty wages. This trend is clear in the United States, where the labor market is bisecting into a small high earning white collar sector and an expanding, low earning service sector. In recent decades, the cost of essentials such as housing, medical care, and nutritious food have outgrown income growth for the average citizen. It's been commonly cited that a near majority of Americans can't afford to cover $ cost in an emergency with their savings. In the 21st century, increasingly our technology will be able to outperform humans in cognitive tasks which will only continue to push down the opportunities for working class citizens to earn a steady wage through their labor. These trends represent the results of technological progress in a capitalist economy, whereby production capacity is widely expanded but the benefits are concentrated within an elite group of capital owners and private corporations.</p>
<p>To extend the benefits of the scientific and industrial revolutions throughout all of society would require an economic system that is designed with the intention of doing so. In place of a system that is centrally focused on growth, an alternative system could focus on the stable production and distribution of needed goods and services, such as housing, health care, food, and accessible recreation, while doing so sustainably. In our individualistic and consumeristic western culture, we tend to see this possibility as gray and uninspiring. But, in truth there is much more to be gained from a psychological and emotional perspective if we make this change the right way. When we take growth out of the center of our economic system, we can also take the economic system out of the center of our cultural and political systems. By creating an economic system built for sufficiency, stability, and sustainability, we can turn our attention to the other dimensions of life which truly allow us to flourish mentally and emotionally. Namely, we can invest in our relationships, group recreational activities, the creative arts, or whatever pursuits an individual may take up in their time of leisure.</p>
<p>Of course, to make this possible, the question of designing the economic system comes to the fore. InA Theory of Justice, first published in 1973, John Rawls argued that a just society should be organized around two basic principles: (1) Each person has an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties compatible with similar liberties for others (2) Social and economic inequalities are justified by the benefits their existence extends to the least advantaged members and are attainable to all. Although I am more focused on finding functional processes that can lead to an improved society, compared to the prevailing system, rather than making sure just principles are always held, I believe these are both decent benchmarks. Although Rawls maintained that a liberal socialist system could conceivably meet his principles, he himself wrote from a Liberal-Captialist perspective. In his conception the state was responsible for guaranteeing a set of basic negative rights, freedomfromreligious persecution for example or freedomfromhaving one's speech infringed upon, and for creating conditions for fair competition in the marketplace where private capital ownership is maintained. In the system he described, individuals are mostly responsible for having their needs met by way of providing wage-labor into a private market system. If the market is not able to provide enough for people in such a way that makes inequality justified for them, the state would take redistributive action.</p>
<p>After nearly 15 years, in the introduction to his 1990 revision of A Theory of Justice, Rawls expressed doubt that a welfare state would be sufficient to protect the principles of justice in the context of a free market economy wherein concentrations of wealth would degrade equality of opportunity and leverage its power to manipulate and direct the political system. In place of the free market + welfare state dynamic, Rawls advocated  for a system he called a property-owning democracy where capital ownership was widely distributed. It's not clear to me how a property owning democracy would be organized or maintained, or whether it could solve fundamental economic and ecological problems within Capitalism. However, I believe it may be possible to build a new set of economic and political structures which can overcome the challenges presented by capitalism without being shackled to an overly centralized and undemocratic command and control system. To find an outline for the political-economic institutional design that could be effective, stable, and sustainable, I will explore a possible synthesis between supportive, egalitarian relational societies and our modern, technological abstract societies.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Structure[15]</h3>
<p>Learning from the shortcomings of the private market system, reciprocalism should be designed to have the highest degree of stability for those activities which are most central to meeting a person's fundamental needs. Access to food, housing, medical care, and community engagement should not be dependent on what's happening in the periphery, where lower stakes activities are managed. In order to make this happen, we need to design the economy from the inside out with a stable and effective economic core that arranges activity that is necessary for general wellbeing. Thiseconomic coreis the focus of this section, and it involves organizations that have political and economic dimensions. Society must make use of public institutions for oversight and collective action that are both functional and democratic.[centrality of the economic core]</p>
<p>The finance system includes a fiat currency that is managed by the political state, as is the case in many developed countries. Money is a technology that we can use to facilitate the stability and operations of economic activity. The presence of money in an economic system does not necessarily imply the presence of plutocracy or aristocracy.</p>
<p>In the context of the economic core, economic agencies within the government are providing wages for labor in the system and giving public firms access to sustainable use of resources. It would do so by sending digital credits to an individual's account without needing to take on debt because, fundamentally, money is a product of the human imagination. We don't need a gold standard and we don't need to borrow funds, so long as the money supply is in harmony with accessible resources. All that a person needs to know about the financial system is that other people are working and that currency can help them get access to resources. So long as the production is happening and products reach consumer outlets where money mediates exchange, a person will find no issue whether their money is backed by gold, whether it comes from the revenues of their firm, or if it was deposited in their account because of the value of their contributions. At the level of the individual, practically nobody has an understanding of how the money supply works or is managed. Everyone simply uses money because they trust in its ability to mediate transactions, hold value, etcetera. This level of insight should suffice to provide context for this section's content. For more specifics on the finance system, refer to appendix 1.[money is constructed, we can choose its form, function, and flow]</p>
<p>In the pursuit of a synthesis between relational and abstract models of economic production and distribution, the central challenge is marked by the fundamental distinction between these two forms of society. Namely, that we need to create a dynamic where individuals can engage in reciprocal behavior on a large scale with people who they aren't familiar with and whose work they don't understand the particulars of. Everyone might benefit from working in one system and taking out their share of benefits, but what of the potential free rider? This is where cultural values play a powerful, but not wholly sufficient, role. In a society of people who recognize that cooperation is the means through which they are able to live free from fears of material scarcity and which enables them to have free time to engage in communal and cultural activities, it is very important for social norms to place an expectation that everyone contributes to the extent that they can. In this context, to be a free rider is to bring on the scorn of others in your community in whose view such a person is not only violating their value system but is taking advantage of everyone else around them. In this case, a would-be free rider is incentivized to conform in order to maintain their relationships, reputation, and sense of self esteem. These forces were sufficient to keep many relational societies prosperous, insofar as material needs could be met, leisure time was accessible, and the diversity of available resources and economic strategies meant there was not much fear of collapse.[16]In the context of abstract society, the fact of individual anonymity (or that there are not community wide relationships from which a person cannot hide) means we need other economic and political structures to reinforce cultural and normative features that incentivize cooperation. [cooperation & cultural features]</p>
<p>In abstract societies, while I argue the cultural significance of achieving wealth and status within socially relevant hierarchies is a powerful motivating force behind the career pursuits of economic elites, it can't be denied that the desire for dispensable resources is an important motivating feature for everyone in contemporary society. Regardless of whether the rewards of pursuing higher incomes and wealth for the sake of making consumer expenditures is even close to the power of the desire which motivates the individual to do so, the fact is that this desire exists and is a powerful motivating force for people. Fools gold or not, consumerism could not flourish as a cultural system if it were not capable of instilling within a wide variety of individuals the desire to obtain the new, the fashionable, the meaningful, and the entertaining qualities of consumer goods and experiences. Until a more utopian future is possible, a scheme for providing material rewards for economic contributions can serve to stabilize the system and incentivize productive behavior. To facilitate alignment between individuals and society, I propose a dynamic wage that reflects the value contributed to the collective economic core and can function as a mechanism of reciprocity between individual economic agents and the general public, to whom they have no personal relation but who are the beneficiaries of their economic activity. (While wages in a private market system are determined by a mixture of value contributed and organizational leverage in the context of revenue generating activity, the wages in this context are not tied to revenue but to value contributed to the system.)  [economic incentives playing a role]</p>
<p>InA Theory of JusticeRawls postulates that the inequalities present within a just society must serve the interest of the least advantaged. He held that inequalities in wealth and income may be necessary to motivate people to perform socially beneficial tasks that are difficult or require training and talent. The idea is that if positions that require greater responsibility or skill offer greater rewards, more people will be motivated to qualify for these positions, leading to more efficient and productive work. This increased productivity can lead to a larger “pie” of resources and wealth, a smaller share of which might be advantageous to an equal share of a smaller pie. Although I agree with Rawls on the point that a greater reward can make it easier to fill important positions with capable individuals, there is a very important distinction between the way an individual receives a higher income in a private market system vs the cooperative structure I'm suggesting. In order for a system of inequality to benefit society as much as possible,the value of individual contributions should besocialized,by which I mean accessible to and shared by the public. Their remuneration should be based on a reward given to them by the society which benefits from their contribution. Not the amount of leverage they have in transacting with individuals over privately owned resources and services.</p>
<p>Consider a surgeon, who must undergo a long and intensive training period before they can begin working. Their contributions are unique, unable to be performed by a layperson, and highly valuable. Rawls and I would agree that it's to the benefit of society for surgeons to be more highly rewarded than the average worker. However, in the case of a private market economy such as in the United States, the surgeon is rewarded not only for the importance of their work but for the leverage they have over consumers, whose inelastic demand means hospitals can set the price as they choose, often thrusting the consumer into crippling debt. In the cooperative context, the surgeon's services are functionally free to the consumer at the point of service. The income that the surgeon receives is not based on their ability to leverage market power in order to drive up revenues, rather it is a reciprocal offering from the rest of society which benefits from the surgeon's contributions to the common good. One can imagine that chefs, home builders, and clothing producers are willing to put more effort into products for doctors knowing that, functionally, they are receiving the ability to obtain medical services on an as needed basis. Now, the system must be constructed such that even a doctor cannot amass so many resources that others are unable to meet their own needs. This happens in market economies, where the wealthy invest in multiple housing properties or real estate investments for their own luxury or economic gain, which drives up the cost of housing for working class people who struggle to pay rent and remain housed. The reciprocal wage can be seen as the material correlate to a culture that respects and values people for what they're doing for others, reinforcing the centrality of reciprocity as a value. In this context, to gain an unequal share of resources a person truly has to deserve it.[example - earning inequality]</p>
<p>In order to function effectively and facilitate necessary production in a cooperative abstract society, the reciprocal wage must be dynamic. For a worker who contributes to the economic core to be paid in accordance with the social value of their labor, then there needs to be a process by which that value can be reasonably approximated. One aspect of that process must be that reciprocal wages change to reflect social needs in a given economic period. Although there needs to be stability so that workers can make career decisions based on more than just what they're going to be paid in the first year, the wage has to communicate to the public which positions society needs to fill the most. If we need more plumbers and less therapists, then wages need to adjust to incentivize workers to take on projects that society has a greater need for.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a dynamic wage is one argument that academic economists make for having a competitive market economy, although in practice wages are not so much based on marginal value (as they should be according to theory) but based on negotiation leverage. In this cooperative system, the first component of wage is the value of one's work to society and the second is the relative need for incentive. A construction worker would be paid to reflect the fact that society really appreciates the work people put in to build and maintain the housing stock, this is one of the most important roles in the economy because of how central the need for housing is to all human beings. Under Capitalism, the construction worker is not only more expendable, their primary use to their organization is to produce more value than they are compensated for so that shareholders and upper management can become wealthy off their efforts.[reciprocal wage = value contribution * dynamic/scarcity multiplier]</p>
<p>In addition to a dynamic wage, where workers are compensated based on an approximation of the marginal social value of their contributions to the economic core, I believe it is important to institute a guaranteed social minimum accessible to everyone in society. This could take the form of a basic set of goods and services that are provided as a baseline to individuals who are uninvolved in the economic system for whatever reason, whether it's because they are experiencing health challenges, in recovery from substance use, or even if they're just angry at the world and they hate everyone around them. The level at which this minimum is set, and the form it takes, will depend on the overall productivity of the economy. However, if society agrees that we don't want people to be malnourished, unhoused, and without support if they're going through any sort of crisis in their lives, then there needs to be a basic safety net that is capable of catching people who fall through the system. At the very minimum, it would take a very manageable fraction of total output to have comfortable dormitories with cafeterias, access to mental health specialists, access to staff that help with transitions, and where a person could feel safe in a crisis. This doesn't have to be the Ritz Carlton in order to serve the basic function.[we should have a basic economic core]</p>
<p>Private market systems depend on two types of incentives, namely the carrot and the stick. In practice, if we were to look at a curve mapping wealth inequality, the carrot end of the spectrum would represent massive economic power. A level of wealth that practically defies the possibility of spending it meaningfully. It's a world where space tourism is an emerging market because there are people who have the disposable income to spend $200,000 for a ride into low orbit and not notice the difference in their bank accounts. At the other end, houselessness and the fear of material destitution is a torturous experience. In between these two extremes, the territory for everyday workers is becoming increasingly unstable and unrewarding as job opportunities in the service sector displace those which had once been entryways into the middle class.[We don't need the severe carrot or the stick]</p>
<p>We live in a time where technological productivity, specifically in relation to the production of necessary goods and services, is greater than people even 150 years ago could have possibly imagined. The United States has over 350,000,000 people in it. Only ~1.3% of people are employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting sectors and yet the USA is a net exporter of food[17]. Access to information about health and medical technology is literally at our fingertips, and increasingly there will be universal access to expert level consulting due to the rise of artificial intelligence software that can organize information far more effectively than search engines, which themselves represented a landmark shift in information accessibility. The broader point is that the scientific revolution and industrialization have given humanity massive upgrades in the productivity of labor.</p>
<p>It would be paradoxical to commit to an economic system that is only becoming more unequal and unstablebecauseour technology and production methods are so efficient that workers are increasingly replaceable and unnecessary, unless they can be hired at or around minimum wage levels. The US economy, which is the richest and most powerful in the world, is not able to offer individual workers the ability to provide stability for themselves and their families if they're willing to work. If we replaced the private market system with a cooperative model with the features I've detailed, then we can meaningfully go to everyone and say that if they are willing to work in order to support others that we will take care of them. This reciprocal agreement, which could be seen as a new generation truly agreeing to sign a social contract that can replicate the reciprocity inherent in the fundamental exchange, can be a far better deal for the supermajority of people as all of society reaps the benefits of a productive economy.[efficiency → mandate and an opportunity to cooperate]</p>
<p>Admittedly, even if we hold the basic premise that cooperation of this sort is able to provide more stability across the board within a society, that does not necessarily mean that individuals in the context where such a system is in place are going to choose to cooperate. What we find here is a sort of prisoner's dilemma. Fortunately, this is exactly the niche where our cultural values can guide individuals towards better outcomes. I mentioned earlier that Bichhieri's research on social norms suggest their function is best applied where there is the possibility for mutual gain but narrow self interest might guide people towards detraction. The driving force behind the impulse to follow a social norm is a person's understanding that other people expect them to conform in this particular way. In a world where people grow up knowing that the prosperity in their society is the result of people choosing to cooperate and work for each other, where everyone expects everyone else to do their best to find a way to contribute that is agreeable to their interests and abilities, and where not doing so is seen as being selfish and manipulative, I do not expect broad swaths of society to detract and just try to live off of the socially guaranteed economic floor. Perhaps the reader might think that they would cooperate, and perhaps their friends and family would as well, but that someotherpeople would just take advantage of the system. I believe this would be a very common response that hits on a fundamental flaw in the rhythm of human reasoning, which is to assume thatotherpeople are really different. Yes, we all grow up in different environments but there are basic emotional and psychological features of human beings that are universal, even if intense circumstances might warp them and lead to maladaptive behaviors. We all have the emotional and psychological programming that makes inclusion in a group meaningful, in terms of how we respond to those interactions, and which calibrates the way we view and feel about ourselves relative to the values and hierarchies around which our peers organize themselves. It is not just that we can wish for an emotional and psychological mechanism that will produce cooperative behavior, it is literally programmed into our minds because on the savanna, group survivalwasalways more important than a person's individual attributes. Mangroves can slow down hurricanes because their roots are deep and their stalks are grouped together.[we can economically cooperate, lean on culture]</p>
<p>Even if people have the knowledge that they could always move into a public dormitory and have a decent standard of living, they're not going to want to do that as long as culture emphasizes the value of contributing to the economic core. In the United States, the fortunate among us have parents who are homeowners and feel like they want to support their children. Faced with a disaster, people like this have the option to move home and know that they're not going to have to worry about being unhoused. Still, because of the cultural values inherent in American society, most people are going to want to get out on their own, find agreeable work, and move in the direction of whatever goals they have for themselves. Many people who do choose to move back in with their parents are largely doing so because they care about their families and derive value from living in a multigenerational home. This represents a different cultural value, but like the preceding example it does not reflect an internal desire to take advantage of other people. People might not always find motivation in the options in front of them, but that doesn't mean that laziness is our nature or even our preferred state. It's not human nature to just get by doing the minimum and living off of other people's work. It's our nature to want to contribute and earn the respect of our peers. The reason that's in our nature is because it helped foster group stability in our evolutionary niche. And, it's still in our nature we just need to create the right social expectations and cultural conditions. Personally, I believe we are at our best when there is something we care about and want for ourselves. We benefit from goals, structure, mentorship, peer support, and other features of an active lifestyle. So, a situation where individuals can find an area of the economy to contribute to and then have enough time and opportunities to be with friends and to find passion in their life is more rewarding than even than the narrow pursuit of wealth, which even in our system is most often going to require an enormous dedication of time and energy.[we are not inherently lazy]</p>
<p>The level of productivity within the economic core will largely determine the extent to which the income inequality spectrum reflects the diversity of interests among the population. Some people might prefer to pursue activities that will result in greater standing and disposable income, and so they will take on an education and apprenticeship that guides them in that direction. Others might have more interest in arts, leisure, or community experiences that are low in resource consumption and so their economic contributions don't need to be as great. Both kinds of people are being given the tools they need by society in order to pursue their interests, which is a very important measuring stick we should use for evaluating and comparing societies. To what extent are people within these societies have the ability to pursue a lifestyle that they desire and or feel satisfied with.[importance of positive freedoms]</p>
<h3>Towards a Constructive Culture</h3>
<p>I would like to acknowledge that this section is speculative and my hope would be to become much more familiar with research in cultural studies so that I can develop a clearer understanding of how economic and cultural systems interact. The following contains some of my general suspicions having grown up in an upper class suburb and spent multiple years as a community organizer in working class communities.</p>
<p>It is my deeply held suspicion that quality of life in the United States is not only restricted by economic instability within the working class, but by the subversive nature of dominant systems of cultural values inherent in consumerism and individualism. While the US is locked in the greatest cultural and ideological divide in its history, I believe these general value sets cross the rural/urban divide (as well as the masculine/faminie) and frame each person's view of themselves and others, regardless of other personal characteristics or beliefs. While the pursuit of individual greatness or social standing and the drive to accumulate economic resources are surely strong impulses for people affected by these cultural trends, I believe that these drives and desires are poorly aligned with the individual's wellbeing. On some level, people likely can understand that things like friendship, family, and purposeful activities are more meaningful than social status and the ability to buy consumer goods. This awareness, to the extent that it's meaningfully widespread, is held at the level of cliche and is not as widely reflected in decision making. Much like a person might know that a potential romantic partner is not good for them, their attraction and feelings towards that person might lead them to get married and run away with them, only to face the effects of their mismatch at a later point.[status and wealth are things we desire, not things we need]</p>
<p>In the United States, the matter of one's economic position often takes a central role in their lives no matter where they are on the income distribution. For the working class, work often forces itself into the center of a person's life because if they can't maintain steady and sufficient employment then the other areas of their life will fall apart. The connection between economic status and individual self worth is real for people in this category, as they often feel that their inability to provide a stable middle class lifestyle for their families is a reflection of their personal failure. Similarly, people in middle and upper class communities often compare themselves against others not in terms of whether they are able to pay for the basic essentials but how successful they are measured by wealth or the utilization of disposable income on luxury goods that double as status symbols, everywhere from clothes to international vacations. In a culture where economic status is an important point of comparison between individuals, it also becomes a source of negative self-esteem for those who perceive themselves as less successful. At the same time, I expect people who are the 'winners' in these comparisons derive little value from being so, other than the benefits of not feeling badly about themselves for being a 'loser' in this context. Perhaps vanity takes a prominent role where a person believes they should actually feel better about their accomplishments. This would be where a person tries to explicitly establish their superiority in social settings to drive a positive emotional response to little actual benefit other than making others feel more insecure. This might look like a person speaking on and on about their accomplishments or someone focusing more on making an enviable instagram post rather than enjoying the substance of whatever they're highlighting.[role of social comparison - hedonic treadmill]</p>
<p>As a 3rd generation American, I have seen and experienced an existentialist hue that can grow in the minds of people who grow up with more than enough economically and who don't directly question whether they will have economic stability. My grandparents worked hard because the focus of their life was to achieve middle class status to give their children a better life economically than they had. I saw my parents try to go even further and give their children as many options as possible, to give us a happy childhood fueled with expensive vacations and bountiful Christmases. I grew up in this context, the beneficiary of 100 years of hard work, and started to wonder what is the point? Why live in a big house if you don't use it to host friends? Why buy memories on the marketplace if there's nobody to share them with? How can a person pursue their own shallow desires while others starve and the world's ecosystems bend towards collapse? [the American dream achieved, for what?]</p>
<p>Once a person can feed, house, clothe, and insure themselves, what often follows is the natural questioning of 'what is my reason for living' and 'what is the purpose of my life'. If, when looking at those questions directly, a person recognizes that they feel no reason to live and cannot identify a purpose that they actually care about, it can lead to a debilitating depression. Others in these circumstances may find motivation in maintaining their class position or affluent lifestyle, where their existentialist sibling already believes that those goals are not meaningful ends in themselves. That there are lots of rich and miserable people because wealth beyond stability does not fill an immediate human need like a sandwich does for the hungry or a friendship does for the lonely. Again, we didn't evolve to live alone. We evolved to be productively and psycho-emotionally interdependent with the others in our community, as a way of strengthening the only vehicle that mattered for survival on the savanna - the group. [beyond survival, the existentialist tendency is to ask oneself - why?]</p>
<p>And I think that for people who may feel that way, the responses are not to try and compete with other people for high positions of social rank. Don't just put your head down and work for whatever the first thing you want is. It's about trying to find something for which the value is noncomparative. Goals  that substantively matter to them in their own individual way. I believe this sphere is, you know, personal connection relationships, the sense of being part of a community, personal expression, the arts. I think that we are fortunate as human beings to actually have a large number of possibilities for how we can live good lives, but it requires a certain level of cultural guidance to make that the established norm. And in order to even reach a situation such as that, we first have to be intentional about what kinds of cultural changes we want to make. [a free life must be meaningful, an unfree life needs only the meaning of survival. This is the challenge ahead of us, to solve the problem of survival so we can address the problem of meaning. I believe the free life is best experienced when meaning comes from one's relationship to their community, in explicit and implicit ways, as in relational society]</p>
<p>My argument is not that a person who has the power to mobilize more resources is in an equally desirable position compared to someone who has less affluence. In fact, I suspect that the global influence of consumerism demonstrates that the desire for more (particularly for more novel things) is a very natural tendency of the human mind. I believe that even if the culture were more focused on community rather than individual standing that people would still want to dress fashionably. If our culture guided people to put more energy into creative and competitive (when healthy) pursuits in life rather than centrally focusing on economic status, assuming they had the time to even do so, that people are still going to want to have a vacation to some warm place in the winter time. The point is that consumption should be something that we put on top of a stable and healthy foundation, it should not be the goal in itself. We should not want to make material achievement the goal because it's not going to fulfill us.[consumption is dessert, if you don't eat your meat how can you have any pudding]</p>
<p>Some people in the upper economic quarter experience their job as actually enjoyable because it has some strategic elements that provide the same sort of intrinsic dopamine releases as a game of chess or basketball does. Competing and winning can be rewarding for the brain, but someone who is satisfied because of this element of their job doesn't even really depend on money for their satisfaction. They may get a kick from making money, but I believe this experience is more closely related to the sense of reward from hitting a home run rather than buying a designer jacket. It's about being rewarded, not about the value of money, past a certain point. My father is a venture capital investor and he wants to work more than he wants to vacation. Growing up, he always wants to workonour vacations. He had dedicated the overwhelming majority of his waking hours towards making money because it represents victory to him, not because spending it makes his life pleasurable or meaningful[18].[c]This is a relevant example because it's the exception that proves the rule. Find a person who loves being rich and they probably just actually get some derivative pleasure from their job rather than from having the wealth. Under a different economic system, people can certainly feel this way about the things they do without needing to be allocated millions of dollars in resources that could otherwise go towards stabilizing the wellbeing of families in poverty.[money = reward/winning for the rich more so than the direct rewards of using the money]</p>
<p>If there truly is a need for a different economic system that can provide material stability on a wide scale while remaining sustainable, then by necessity features of the cultural system will need to change so that people can accept and flourish within the new system.No economic system can function properly unless the feelings and beliefs of the people who operate are aligned with the needs of the system.One of the landmark factors contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union was frustration from within about the inability of that system to provide a western, middle class lifestyle, the images of which were being transmitted across the world and having an Americanizing influence on global culture. The point isn't to say the Soviet system provided a desirable level of general welfare, it didn't. But, a lot of people were not satisfied with a system that seemed to make material sufficiency its end goal for the individual. From their example, we can learn that if we want to build a system based on stability and limited inequality we are going to need people who want to live in that kind of society.[d]Many Americans would think that doing so would be strictly against a person's self interest. They may point to a highly skilled worker in the Soviet Union, and how they would expect a person like that to want to immigrate to the United States where they can make more money. Similar arguments are made in defense of low taxation, to prevent capital flight. This framework that isolates personal economic power depends on the assumption that it is always in a person's self interest to pursue material gains. Contemporary economists try to model economic agents as wealth maximizing because human behavior is hard to model and money is seen as the great medium which can advance any of a person's interests. But, we are not Homo Economicus. We are Homo Sapiens, and if we embrace a culture built around friendship, community, expression, science, and the arts, then we will find ourselves thriving. Yes, we need enough economic resources to live. But, a lot of plants that live off sunlight still grow best in the shade. Likewise, humans thrive when we have what we need and we can thrive in a culture of connectivity and purpose. We need to grapple with the fact that oversimplifying our own lives as narrow pursuits of resource accumulation is bad for individuals and that maintaining a system that is bent on private wealth accumulation and growth is bad for humanity.[alignment and self interest]</p>
<p>The choice to push society beyond consumerism is one where we must actively step off the hedonic treadmill, wherein we keep trying to move in the direction of our consumptive desires but we stay in the same place emotionally. We think we need a certain lifestyle to be happy and then we spend our working hours accumulating enough resources to live the way we want only to find ourselves adjusted to the new norms. It is to our great fortune that our brains can understand that the things which it desires instinctively are not the best things for it. Over time, we are able to internalize the things we know so that we react to the world in a way that emotionally reflects the things we know. We do not have to trap ourselves in a vicious cycle, we should stop and try to ask the important questions about what makes our lives meaningful before we reach the point where we've maximized our status and resources and we find ourselves dissatisfied.[The desire to climb the hedonic treadmill is counter productive]</p>
<p>It's not enough to point out problems in one system because change requires even more building than it does tearing down. The human mind, in its attempts to understand its surroundings, projects meaning onto people, objects, and the relationships between things. If we are going to try and remove large portions of the projection systems that give our lives a sense of meaning, focus on individualism and consumerism, then they must be replaced. This process will never be successful if its is being imposed on one group from another. In the same ways that a band of crusaders could not hold me hostage and convince me to think, feel, and believe as they do, neither could I impose a worldview onto those who disagree with us. The more a person tries to forcefully impose a worldview onto another person, the more their discussion partner will resist them. There are two principles in psychology connected to this phenomena. The first is the "backfire effect" when a person's belief system is being threatened in a charged debate, they will often become more firmly entrenched in their perspective, not less. The other one is called the "reactance theory" which suggests people share a general tendency towards feeling like they are autonomous. So, when they perceive that another person is trying to restrict their beliefs forcefully, they become motivated to resist and combat the threatening argument. If we cannot force anyone to take our side, then we must attract them to a positive vision. No matter how we try to make meaning out of the world in this new context, it has to be convincingly representative of fundamental truths and is compelling to a person living in contemporary culture.[new culture has to be chosen, to be desirable]</p>
<p>The most important general point is this: we can be intentional about developing a culture that is going to make it easier for people to meet their own psycho-emotional needsatthe same timeas we shift towards an economy built on sufficiency and sustainability. On a large scale, I do not believe these two shifts could happen independently of each other because our current economic and cultural systems are interdependent and have a powerful influence on each other. If we are intentional about our values and the type of culture we want to create, then it is a constructive alternative that sets the table for a radical improvement in economic and social terms. We should not consider these pathways separately, but see that there may exist a general theory on the improvement of society that can be formulated with the knowledge we have of history and the contemporary world. [Culture and economic shifts have to occur simultaneously]</p>
<h3>Systemically Inherent Communities</h3>
<p>In many ways, values are the foundation beneath a culture. Sometimes that's reflected in our ideals or the ways we wished things could be. More often, however, the value judgment is implicit in our actions. We often think that we know the things we value the most in our lives and yet they are not necessarily how we orient our priorities. A person might say family is the most important thing to them and yet they choose to spend more time at the pub or in front of the television rather than engaging with their spouse and children. Although I think it is important to believe in certain social values cognitively even if they are not reflected in one's actions,buy-in-largevalues are things that we need topracticein order for them to be meaningful. I want to live my life such that my values can be ascertained from my priorities, and if society is going to live with pro-social values, it will not be enough for those to be held in private. Rather, they must be demonstrated through action and repetition.[values must be demonstrated, not simply held]</p>
<p>This is an important caveat to my message here. Just as I believe it is insufficient to design a possible cooperative economic system if the goal is to generate buy-in and enthusiasm, I also think that a shift in values is a critical but insufficient aspect of broader social change. We must not only value community in an abstract sense, we need to live in a way that reflects that value otherwise we will not experience the benefits. I believe there are a tremendous number of people in the United States who want to live with a vibrant community around them but have no access to people who would meaningfully fill that need. As people, our drive towards acceptance and connection makes friendship and community desirable features of a person's life, but our society is not properly structured to help us easily meet those needs. This is another fundamental difference between relational and contemporary abstract societies, namely the modern absence of systemically inherent communities.[we need inherent community]</p>
<p>There is an important degree of nuance in this statement because my point is not that some people experience community as an inherent feature of their lives, but rather that society is not ordered in such a way that makes it easy for everyone to experience community to a fulfilling degree. The extent to which the gap between our psycho-emotional needs for friendship and community and what people experience is a multi dimensional sociological phenomena. In the context of my own cultural heritage, my grandparents and more distant ancestors experienced a higher degree of inherent community by way of their kinship networks and communities of faith, namely the Greek Orthodox Church. In recent generations, these institutions have been fading as our communities secularize, where true faith in Western monotheism is fading without the emergence of a new community institution to fill the gap, and individualism has pushed families further apart, literally with single family homes and geographic mobility. While a great many people still find community in these and other places, I believe it is generally true that our communities are becoming smaller across the board to the detriment of everyone involved.[Inherent community in local kinship networks and faith are shrinking without replacement]</p>
<p>If we are going to try and build a new culture around connection, cooperation, and purposeful living, then we're going to need to build social institutions that make it practically effortless for people to engage in community. If we are going to take economic production out of the center of a person's life, then we're going to need to reduce the number of labor hours most people work. In a world that is focused on getting people the things they need and giving them the choice between leisure and more labor, then this should be possible because we are not working to make a small share of the population famously wealthy. If that is possible, then we're going to need mechanisms by which people can replace work as the center of life with other things. For some, it might be creative expression, for others it may be family, for others it may be contributing to the community through their profession. The point is that people need the option to choose and society needs to be sure that people who want to invest in some activity have a space and community to do it with. [replacing economics with community at the center of our lives]</p>
<p>The more a person asks what they actually want from their lives, the more they will turn to different pursuits that will give them a sense of purpose or fulfillment. And, as we pursue any endeavor we should naturally be pulled to do so with others who have similar interests or goals. People who want to feel closer to God are benefited by the relationships they have to others who partake in the community of people with the same goal. In my youth, I wanted to play baseball and I ended up forming great relationships with others who wanted the same thing. Communities are often the byproduct of people gathering for some other effort, although the experience of community that is initially a byproduct often becomes the most rewarding element.[Community is a byproduct of meaningful, joint pursuits]</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>At the outset of this paper, we considered the fundamental differences between modern abstract societies and the relational societies that humans evolved to live in. The hope was to lay out a framework that can help us think about solving problems at high levels of social abstraction without neglecting concerns about human nature and the foundations of our wellbeing. I explained my conception of the fundamental exchange in order to illustrate the way in which individuals in egalitarian relational societies related to the community at large. Because the group could provide things for the individual which they could not furnish for themselves, and the group needs buy-in from its members, the fundamental exchange represents an alignment between individual and group interests. There are certainly complications involved in reproducing this dynamic in a world full of strangers and complicated systems. But, I am confident that there is a potential formulation of society that is more effective at meeting each person's economic and psycho-emotional needs while making dramatic improvements to macro level sustainability. That's not to say we're going to realize this form, only to recognize that it is  probably both possible and desirable. In a world where there is less and less hope for the future, where people are more and more alienated from each other, and the private market system is withholding the benefits of technological innovations, could there not be a movement around some goal that might tackle each of these major problems?</p>
<p>If there will be another stage for humanity beyond Capitalism, beyond Individualism, and beyond Consumerism, let it be one that we have chosen because of the benefits it can provide. Insofar as culture connected individuals and their groups, a value set based on connection, cooperation, and purpose can be an effective bridge that supports the needs and flourishing of individuals as well as the group. Reciprocalism is a sort of socialism that doesn't depend on people acting against their self interest, it leverages the inherently social features of self interest to create alignment between the wants and needs of individuals and their groups.</p>
<h3>Appendix 1 - Macroeconomics</h3>
<p>The objective of this paper is to provide an introduction into my framework and vision for future research and development for a new social paradigm that I believe is conceivable and desirable. The elements of this paper are intentionally abstract as I am attempting to construct the broad framework within which I will conduct further research, to question and alter my assumptions, and writing, to expand on, clarify, and alter the ideas which I have presented. The most ambitious claim that I am making is that society can have an economic system that is the engine for general prosperity without relying on a relatively small ruling class, whether that is of capitalists and economic plutocrats or of dictators and single party states. This appendix is meant to provide further illustration of the system's economic design which is indispensable to my general theory, although the ideas are undoubtedly weaker than they will be after having time to dedicate myself to research and development full time. The appendix will begin with a consideration of the monetary system before diving deeper into the political-economic architecture.</p>
<h3>Monetary Fundamentals</h3>
<p>At the foundation of the monetary system is a particular position on the philosophy of money. In relational societies, as mentioned earlier, what we call economic activity was mediated relationally through an implicit system of social debts/deficits that scholars term the gift economy. It's called that because exchange often looks materially like gift giving, but there are complicated sets of interpersonal expectations that are carried by these interactions. In the context of abstract societies, goods that could easily be broken down without losing its function were often used to mediate exchange. This process led to the use of coinage by governments and empires, which set formal accounts for the weight and symbols associated with recognized currencies. Famously, Roman coins were so widely trusted that they were used in marketplaces as far as India and possibly China. In the 20th century, the process of linking currency to some valued commodity was abandoned as governments realized that they didn't need the commodity in order for people to have faith in a currency. It only needed to be functional, that people could expect other people to recognize its value.[gift > gold > fiat]</p>
<p>In the context of a fiat money economy, the government can produce notes or increase the money supply without needing to increase its own holdings of an associated commodity or asset. The goal is to have a quantity of money in the economy that keeps it in balance with the amount of available resources. One does not produce wealth simply by printing money, but an increase in the amount of money individuals have can increase wealth if it allows them to use that money to mobilize previously unproductive assets. As such, a government which produces the money used in its domestic economy, assuming it's capable of producing significant value and is not overly dependent on trade with more productive countries, can spend money without having to obtain it first through taxation. This insight is at the center of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which is a heterodox approach within academic economics departments which challenges the notion that a government's financial deficit is a liability to the country. However, my approach should not be seen as in alignment with this movement. I am skeptical of the confidence of MMT theorists who try to apply this insight to shift the paradigm of the government's role in Capitalist economies. Because prices and wages are entirely being set by private firms, and the value of a given currency is influenced by international markets, leading to limitations in the influence of a government in their domestic economy by risking the threat of inflation.[money is made up, but MMT is sus]</p>
<p>In the context of a new society designed to effectively facilitate cooperation, a number of new possibilities follow from the fact that money is functionally an invention of the human mind with no necessary basis other than a general agreement on its form and purpose. For example, a single nation or a collaborative of economies and governments, such as the EU/Eurozone, could choose to have not one single currency but a small group of currencies that are defined and used differently to more effectively achieve particular economic goals. For example, a job might pay X green credits, Y blue credits, and Z purple credits. In a system where green credits are used for food, blue credits are used for housing upgrades and amenities, and purple credits are for general consumer spending, it will be easier to make sure that the most important goods and services aren't being gobbled up by a few high earners. Surgeons who have been working for a long time in the United States have enough money to buy multiple housing properties. A similar person in the hypothetical society would be provided more resources than the average worker, because what they're doing is important for the general welfare, but their earnings curve could lead to diminishing marginal returns in blue credits so they don't have the market power to restrict housing opportunities for other people. This is the case under Capitalism where investments in housing and property from the rich drive up the price of real estate and make housing more unaffordable and unstable for citizens at the lower end of the inequality curve.[the possibilities]</p>
<p>For the sake of clarifying what I consider the most important elements of the economic system, I am largely containing my analysis to the economic core of a single, sufficiently large and diverse, nation. Implicit in this approach is the view that a cooperative nation of this kind is better served organizing domestic labor for the joint benefit of its citizens rather than focusing entirely on specialization and trade on the international market, which is the dominant approach in capitalist economies following the principles of relative advantage. Still, I am not making the claim that any economy which is choosing to adopt a cooperative social structure will be capable or even desire being entirely self-sufficient. The important note here is that international trade with capitalist nations would still be functional, as long as the cooperative economy is producing value it can buy and sell in the international market using foreign currencies. Whether the Capitalist world would make the political/military choice to embargo cooperative economies to disincentivize other countries from adopting a model that is hostile to the interests of international capital is beyond the scope of this analysis.[international trade still possible]</p>
<h3>Economic System Design</h3>
<p>The overall goal is to create a system which can achieve the desired economic ends, to provide stability for workers and sustainability for the society at large, through proper means, through which workers are being fairly compensated, respected, and motivated. Designing a general architecture of the economic core of a cooperative society requires involving the political and economic spheres. When they are entirely separate, firms pursue their own economic self interest to the detriment of whatever is in their way or affected by their activity. When they are entirely the same, the government may resort to dictatorial control over workplaces where they make poorly informed decisions and are in conflict with the working class. If the ideal outcome of this society is a mutually beneficial collaboration between members of society then this relationship should be reflected in the dynamic between government institutions and economic firms. Of course, the following suggestions are only a first approximation of a potential structure, intended to provide a starting point for considering different forms of institutional design rather than to advocate for the installment of a narrow formulation.</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Diagram 1 represents therelationships between different categories of stakeholders who are involved in the economic core. In the green boxes are public institutions (government, economic agency, citizenship) and the blue boxes are productive institutions (workers, management, firm, industry). A basic assumption in this context is that the individuals in any of these boxes are not necessarily more capable or intelligent than any other as a function of their position. Just because an agency is involved primarily in the public sector does not automatically imply its workers will be less effective in their positions when compared to workers or managers in the productive sector.</p>
<p>In this system, the government plays a critical role both in the production and distribution systems. On the production side, the government creates firms and industry groups which are chartered through a constitutional mandate to pursue production for goods and services that are necessary for the economic core. Funding for these organizations, including employee salaries and the rights to use publicly owned resources. In a general sense, they are similar in design to public utilities insofar as they are given a monopoly over specific activity and are overseen by the government. However, unlike public utilities, firms in this context are not being financed by selling commodities to the public. They work for the government, and their incentives are structured in such a way to facilitate cooperation.</p>
<p>Agencies are staffed with academics in relevant fields, policy experts, and former employees from the relevant industry or firm. They understand how much needs to be produced on what timeline to keep the national economy operating, and they coordinate with industry groups and firms to make sure those goals are being met. As in the comparison with public utilities, capitalist countries have government agencies that oversee activity in various sectors. However, it is not the existence of the organization that ensures its efficacy. In the United States, the government is dependent on private firms for funding and often those firms which are engaged in the most controversial work have the greatest incentive to fund campaigns and divert resources to ensure favorable treatment. In this context, firms do not have the capital to influence political organizations or agencies. They cannot lavishly compensate executives for going back and forth between agencies and the private sector, furthering the industry's cause. In this context, the agency is backed up not only by the government but by the general public, in whose interest it serves by organizing the production of necessary goods.</p>
<p>Industry groups are institutionalized to facilitate activity at the firm level and to coordinate between individual firms within an industry and the overseeing government agency. Having received the general targets from the agency, the industry group works with firms to create their specific goals based on the agency's stated priorities and expectations. They are also responsible for keeping the government happy so the economic agencies don’t have to take direct command over individual firms or industry groups due to under performance, which the firms want. The employees of the industry group are not themselves involved directly in production, this sphere exists specifically to coordinate both between the firms and the agencies and between the firms themselves.</p>
<p>At the firm level, organizations produce according to their mandates, which are set to align with their organizational capacity. In addition to organizing the workers within the firm and the resources they're been allocated by the government, firms also have to coordinate activity with one another. While each firm has a constitutional mandate to work in the service of the public in their areas of expertise, they will often need to coordinate with one another to do so. Under Capitalism, firms pay each other for B2B services that they need and which can more efficiently be provided by outside specialists rather than developing the capacity in house. In this cooperative context, the constitutional mandate that one firm has to pursue their goals extends to other organizations whose support is required towards the necessary ends. So, the two relevant organizations create a bridge committee that includes members from each firm. They negotiate a contract for the exchange of services, even if it is unidirectional, which must be approved by management. If a contract cannot be agreed upon, then the economic agency can get involved and mediate a new contract, possibly increasing the level of compensation the government will provide to firms that are taking on more capacity. In general, these agreements should be anticipated by the industry group so that contracts can be agreed upon before negotiations threaten to slow production.</p>
<p>Firms are organized hierarchically for the sake of productivity and incentive alignment, without the benefits of which any inequality of power within the firm would be unjustified. Given the goals of this system are to stabilize necessary economic production and to promote sustainability, I am willing to compromise on the goal of universal egalitarianism in order to pursue these specific ends. Hierarchically organized firms within Capitalism are productive, and not overly disagreeable so long as the structure is generally seen as rational. When leadership is deserved, the people in those roles can provide mentorship to workers and direction to the firm at large. When it is undeserved, internal contradictions can build within the organization, undercutting morale and the sense of purpose. Because firms are organized hierarchically, there is a proportion of workers who do coordination/management roles. These workers don't necessarily work harder than others, but their actions have powerful consequences because they influence the product of the entire working body. So, a healthy and effective firm needs to have good leaders. But, they should not impose their power on the working body, rather they should be given their power by the workers.</p>
<p>Management, therefore, would be elected by the body of workers within the firm. Managers are more likely to be the people who are the most respected or trusted workers within the firm, rather than those who were favored by previous management or who sought their own career advancement over other priorities, such as being helpful to their peers. This level of democracy is particularly effective because firms are small enough to be ruled by relational dynamics rather than abstract ones. A person who wins a statewide election with millions of voters is able to fabricate their own public image to manipulate the public into believing in them through the mobilization of a certain kind of mythology. A worker who wants to move into a management role cannot hide from the way they treat others in the workplace and how their perception in the organization is informed by gossip. A manager thus should be a worker who is given a different set of tasks. Instead of being responsible for a certain aspect of the work, the manager is responsible for making sure each aspect is coming along and that each worker has the resources they need. Whereas a worker has their wage set to approximate the value they're contributing to the economic core, and therefore to others in society, the manager has their wage set based on the effectiveness of an organization to hit its quotas. So, the coordinator-workers have their incentives tied to the public's need for firms to be producing according to their capacity. Managers are both subject to recall from the workers who elected them, they also can be removed by the economic agency if their organization continues to underperform targets for reasons other than external constraints.</p>
<p>The role of workers has already been discussed in the paper's cooperative structure section. Workers are compensated according to the social value of their productivity in order to create a reciprocal dynamic between individuals and society. No matter how this system is constructed, one should recognize that the unavoidable imperfections should be accepted for the sake of reaching a general improvement over the prevailing system. As we're trying to consider how people can work together for a society that is sustainable and without poverty, we must keep in mind the best frame for comparison is not the ideal but the currently actualized. It is conceivable to me that members of the economic agencies can, in tandem with advanced algorithms that can identify labor bottlenecks in the system, set a range of income for various different jobs. Then, managerial and peer evaluations at the firm level can collapse the range onto a single number.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the system, citizens elect government leadership and consume goods available to them at the marketplace at prices that are set by either a governmental organization, like the agencies, that specifically focuses on consumer price balancing, or by government chartered firms that are tasked with balancing supply and demand in markets related to their industry. Either way, anyone who defends a system like this must first defend the possibility of an effective price setting system. Frederick Hayek was the most influential classical economist in the mid 20th century, serving as a rival to Keynes and a source of inspiration for Milton Friedman. In 1945, he wrote a paper(name)discussing the necessity for decentralized agents in an economy to set prices with their particular understanding of supply and demand in their local area. While this paper demonstrated a significant challenge for heavily centralized economies which often struggled to set prices effectively, the critique has gone stale in the midst of the computational revolution. Giant firms like Walmart, CVS, and Amazon are intimately familiar with setting prices for goods for consumer markets across the country. The consolidation of major industries in the United States into a smaller and smaller group of more dominant firms demonstrates the feasibility of highly scaled economic operations, despite questions regarding sufficient information and processes to determine prices.</p>
<h3>Appendix 2 - Culture & Community</h3>
<h3>Envisioning Inherent Community</h3>
<p>In order to have community as a feature that is systematically inherent within an abstract society, there need to be design innovations to account for scale and anonymity. It is relatively simple to visualize a person being born into a community of 100 people who hunt together, gather together, and share a cultural fabric. From birth they are members of the community and their lives will consist of moving through a variety of roles that are passed through at different stages of life. They might commune with other regional tribes for the sake of a religious festival or ceremonial exchange of gifts, but the interaction would be between two groups without the involvement of stray individuals, who would be treated with suspicion unless they could tie themselves somehow to a groups kinship network. A person might even fall in love with a person from another community and, depending on custom, one of them might choose to join the other's community. In this case, that individual certainly has left the community of their origin, showing that an inherent community is not necessarily a permanent one. Still, what they have lost is functionally replaced as they now take on a new social role in a group of people who will quickly turn from strangers to kin. In all likelihood, the marriage will strengthen the bond between the two groups from which each of the two came from. The communal bonding of families or communities through marriage is a cultural institution that all students have come across in even the most basic courses of history.</p>
<p>So we can see that in a relational context how community is inherent to society in a way that is fundamentally different than in the abstract context. In the 21st Century, you can work, eat, live, and buy without necessarily being relationally close to other people. So, there is a certain challenge in designing a system so that a person who seeks community in their lives is able to do in approximately the manner of their liking, by which I mean they are able to choose a community that they want to be a part of rather than choosing among unfavorable options. For instance, I may personally feel alienated by the dominance of alcoholic consumption and video gaming that dominates the culture among the people I know in my geographic area. If I want to experience community, I could choose to involve myself in the downtown bar scene or to attend religious gatherings at the local Greek Orthodox Church. But, in both cases I would not be fulfilling my need because it is not only to be involved inacommunity that I would find fulfilling, but for me to fitwithina community. So, if we want our societies to have inherent communities they must be numerable enough to accommodate the diversity of interests in a large scale, abstract society.</p>
<p>As this is a feature of culture rather than economics, where the particulars of the system's design are very important to align the interests of individuals and society, it would be impossible to say how a community must present itself to meet people's needs. It's safe to assume that the number of possible vehicles for satisfying community in society is likely very wide and diverse. Still, for the sake of example, let's consider what inherent community could look like in a successful reciprocalist society of our imagination. Let's assume that people have become accustomed to this system's design and generally find it in their interest to contribute economically both in order to meet the expectations of their role models and peer groups but also to have some extra resources to expend at their will. In such a world, a person would naturally be a part of their work community and a constituent of their local political community, but there is no guarantee they will find satisfying connection in either of these places. Yes, with more flexibility to choose their vocation they may find their coworkers make good friends, but we cannot assume everyone would have this experience. At first glance, it becomes clear that so long as society is abstract that a person does nothaveto be in a community if they don't make an attempt. So, how can a person like this claim to have community as an inherent feature of their lives?</p>
<p>Let's assume that this society has a slightly different calendar which includes a 6 day week. In order to comfortably produce, distribute, and maintain the economic system relating to basic material needs, everyone of working age contributes approximately 8 hours of labor for 3 days a week. Many of the architects, doctors, teachers, managers, and researchers choose to work more because they find their work fulfilling, enjoyable, and they enjoy the use of an extra paycheck to furnish their families with vacations and additional goods. But, not everyone is like this. Take Robbie for example. He works in logistics at the federal postal service, a job that he took because an academic mentor noticed his affinity for puzzles and suggested an occupation that might scratch the same itch. It's a good fit, but after a few years Robbie begins to feel that his employment of technical problem solving at work has dulled his interest in puzzles, which he and a small group of friends used to get together and do for at least a few hours every week. He decides that he wants more than a new activity, he wants a new community.</p>
<p>In such a world, the stability of the economic and political systems depend on their functioning being something that people can take for granted. So, there is substantial public investment in organizations that can provide access to vibrant communities. The architects, therefore, instituted a system of publicly subsidized organizations which provide space for recreation, gathering, and the formation of lasting communities. The "hives" were built to bring people together around a central interest or objective, the pursuit of which could create the fertile soil for the community to dig its roots into. In the metropolitan area that Robbie lives in, there are a number of hives with physical building spaces in a district downtown. Each hive had a process for onboarding new members, providing information to them about the community and usually giving them a chance to integrate through a buddy system, where a few members would take them under their wing for a period of time while they got acclimated. Each community makes their own rules and protocols and nominates members to take on leadership roles, somewhat like moderators of a subreddit or discord server. In some hives, there were no leaders and members share responsibilities in contributing to the functioning of the group so that everyone can share in the benefits.</p>
<p>Robbie would have the chance to visit different hives, get a sense of their culture, put a feeler out for the activities they did together, and could choose for himself where to plug in. On his journey, he visited one building with 6 stories that had a different hive headquartered on each one. He was there to visit the philosophy of mind reading group, where he was given a tour and a casual introduction to a few members who were hanging around. At the end, he was surprised to receive an application form. It turns out, this hive was an offshoot of a much larger, publicly funded philosophy hive elsewhere in the city. They chose to go private in order to select members who would be particularly committed to doing the readings and engaging in structured debates. Because they operated with selectivity, they didn't receive public funds and had to rely entirely on member dues to cover rent and upkeep.</p>
<p>If the philosophy of mind debate group represents the smaller more closed off community that reflects a very specific niche, the world of warcraft hive was the opposite. Their hive was a huge building where people came to play, compete, discuss strategy, organize tournaments with regional competitors, and hang out. The people there were so enthralled with the game and their community that a lot of people there worked to earn more income so the hive would have more resources than what was allotted by the state. For these and a lot of other people in this world, their hives were at the center of their world. It's where they had fun, spent time with friends, met romantic partners, and worked to build social standing. Robbie decided to join the world of warcraft hive so he could have a light and fun social environment around a game he enjoyed. And, he wrote an application letter to the philosophy of mind group demonstrating that he was a strong fit for their community and willing to contribute the higher share of dues. So, Robbie picked up an extra day every other week at work and became deeply integrated into two very different communities, where he got to enjoy his hobbies and make lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no way to guarantee that people will treat each other the way we might want them too, not without enough social control to make the costs higher than the benefits. But, in a society that is express in its communication not only of communal values but in explaining the utility of those values, it's not hard to imagine the natural capacity of culture to internalize and automatically reproduce the values and norms that were functional and agreeable. In a world that has used social and economic design to move past economic deprivation, there was not the systemic chain of trauma for children in unstable environments, and a world with less trauma is also one with less harm.</p>
<p>[1]Cooperation does not imply voluntary cooperation</p>
<p>[2]You might want to use a higher number and re-word the concept because you don't need to know everyone for a relational system to work, as long as there are shared values and practices.</p>
<p>[3]By this I mean on the material side they don't go hungry or homeless and on the other side they have their health, they have friendships, etcetera. But, maybe this distinction isn't a good one to make. I just think stability is such an important factor over time but it is a factor that have psychological effects.</p>
<p>[4]If I'm not careful, I could get a lot of flack from the indigenous left for talking about different societies having different moral qualities, but I am a moral absolutist and I am trying to say that it's there model that the west should try to replicate, not claim our colonial methods are superior.</p>

<p>[7]Hunger is not just an emotion, it is also a psychological state that alters the way we think, make decisions, and where we place the focus of our cognition.</p>
<p>[8]This distinction is important because in the context of a relational society people aren't just trying to contribute their "labor" as an abstract unit of economic production. It would be more accurate to say people contribute their effort towards activities that were valued by the group, which can mean more than just hunting and gathering, extending to practices we would see as social or cultural in nature.</p>
<p>[9]Original affluent society</p>
<p>[10]This can extend to people who someone doesn't interact with. A professional might feel good about how they are better than others in their field, even if they don't interact with those people.</p>
<p>[11]Note (5/2025): I want to think more about how individual and group behaviors have different rationalities.</p>
<p>[12]Note (5/2025): This section isn't actually focused on the infinite growth paradox. That is, the idea that capitalism required indefinite exponential growth, which is impossible and highly destructive. This isn't a necessary law of economics, it's an organizing principle for the private finance system. Private capital will not extend itself for use unless it expects a high return, which can only be safely guaranteed in a growing economy. When the economy stagnates and retracts, it destroys itself. Damned if you do (grow forever) and damned if you don't.</p>

<p>[a]I know that stability acts primarily on the psychological element but it should be kept distinct. A person could have stability and plenty of treasures and be mentally unwell in large part due to social factors. Also, stability provides a sort of bridge between the psychological and material dimensions</p>
<p>[b]Maybe begin this section by talking about how we want the fundamental exchange to basically describe the relationship between one person and their society (even if their interactions are on the community level, their contributions will be shared across the system). Then explain how it requires certain features of culture and social norms --> brings us to the values that are fundamental to them</p>
<p>[c]Yes, he took advantage of it to do things like go to the Super Bowl but he didn't work so that he could consume, its not his fundamental motivation.</p>
<p>[d]It would not be enough to give everyone 'enough' if they had a stronger desire for wealth compared to leisure, community, art, or expression.</p>
