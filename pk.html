    <h2>Egg Notes</h2>
    <div class="posts-box">
      <div class= "post">When we admit that we haven't done something to a person we had previously assured, is it honest to say we 'didn't have time'? I know people with less volitional leverage over what they do with their time. How much of what we don't do is about lacking the patience, awareness, or intention? Unless it's all about saving face, in which case I resign. </div>
      <div class="post">I've been thinking about an oversimplified illustration of human nature that splits our implicit reasoning (information processing) side from the volitional, conscious side that percieves itself as driving agency. I imagine a set of comics staring a computer in a suit and its pet beaver on a leash. "I can try to reason with you, but you're upsetting my beaver and soon I won't be able to contain him." </div>
      <div class="post">Structuring lives around 3 main stages: play-learning, wander-feeling, and choice-settling? If your society doesn't afford you the opportunities to go through these stages, then you're being stifled. </div>
      <div class="post">I feel like philosophy, science, and narrative can categorize most of what academics are doing. Where science reflects empiricism, philosophy reflects concept construction, and narrative reflects the nature of the relationships between concepts in a given paradigm. </div>
      <div class="post">Fuck dude, I think there's something about collecting that is fundamental in the structure of certain rewarding pathways. The satisfaction of the collection would be the trophy of success in gathering, and success in gathering is the most important and consistent work of the biome native human</div>
      <div class="post">I think there's a lot to be said about companies selling to consumers using a "hooked" model. As in, the business wants the consumer to be hooked on their product, and for the payments to be invisible to the consumer's mind. Never before have people been accidentally forking over money. What if you thought someone was vaccuming money out of your pocket because they hynotised you; I expect you to be pissed. Like, the academic field of economics has been given political cover while its rational choice assumptions have been creativeyl destroyed in psychology. But, you can bet that advertisers have advanced their practices. I think it's quite evident from their success.</div>
      <div class="post">The only implication of determinism is humility. We have to remember that our lives do not change when we reach some disconcerting insight. If we forget what we have learned, we are not freeing ourselves but hiding in our un-freedom. It is much better to face the real limitations that I experience as a feature of the human condition, because then I can direct my faculties towards the researched, proposed, and chosen ends that I can deeply identify with because they are my attempts at true self expression. I find a weak self the first time I am disturbed by my condition. A state that I clock as a sort of existential disphoria. Only those who know how much they are a slave to their genertically programmed instinctive dispositions + the care/harm/stability I experienced in the pre-memory state of infancy = (alone) an incredible force. A force that manifests like this, you go your whole life thinking that you're responsible for who you are and what you want because you can feel the force of your causality, but then when you measuring the world (and measuring the others like you), the indicators suggest that the tide has been moving you the whole time. This is the time to panic. And then, after you've been in pain and yet continued living, after you've realized that you still want things and the world pisses you off, and all the ways it happens to us in different specific ways which are likely so numerous that their collection would fill bookshelves
